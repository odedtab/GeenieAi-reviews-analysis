    "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n I have only been using this keyboard for a half a day, but I really like it so far. There are definitely some things to keep in mind though, and this keyboard is not for everyone. The instructions also aren’t very clear, so I have included more information here.Visuals: The colors are vibrant and pretty. Cycle through red, yellow, green, blue, indigo, magenta, white. *** HOWEVER PLEASE NOTE *** There’s a very weird visual sensation when using the white, and to a lesser extent yellow, colors. If I shake my head, or look back and forth on the keyboard (as if searching for something), it feels like the R, G, and B cones in my eyes are being activated at different times. I get R, G, and B shadows or echoes of the lights. (My husband and his friend get the same thing, so it's not just me.) It’s extremely disorienting and off-putting, enough that I can’t use the keyboard on white or yellow light. The effect is still present with other colors, but MUCH LESS so. The effect is lessened by dimming the keyboard’s lights down to lower settings, and/or turning on more overhead lights or desk lamps. I rarely have overhead lights on, so it’s pretty dark in my office. I therefore need to turn down the keyboard’s brightness anyway. The manual says there are four brightness settings, but there are actually five.Key Layout: This keyboard resembles what I’m used to. You have the double-height plus and enter keys, and the double-width zero on the number pad. The tab, caps lock, shift, backspace, backslash, return, and shift keys are all also bar-style (wider than normal keys). I didn’t realize how important it is for me, but even small things (like a backwards-L shaped return key) can throw me off significantly. I love that this keyboard has a normal layout. There are also spaces between every four function keys, which helps me hit the right key without looking.Ergonomics: Mechanical switches have a decently long keystroke, so that may be an issue for some. If you're looking for short strokes or low profile, this keyboard is not for you. The red switches in this keyboard take very little effort to press though, and my hands haven’t felt tired or strained while using it. So it definitely qualifies as soft touch, IMO.Sound: This keyboard is definitely louder than scissor-switch/chicklet style keys. I will include a video with my review so you can get a feel for the sound. It’s not a sharp sound like from a typewriter, it’s a softer type of sound. It’s also not off-putting, but definitely worth mentioning. Nobody’s gonna sleep in the room while you’re using this keyboard.Function Keys: All function keys execute their normal/default function in software. You have to hold down the Fn key in order to use the media shortcuts on the Function keys. This is exactly how I need my keyboard to function, so that makes me very happy.Controls:Fn+Ins | Toggle through the various modesFn+Del | Toggle through colorsFn+Up & Fn+Down | Adjust BrightnessFn+Left & Fn+Right | Adjust animation speedFn+Home | Start or finish editing current gamer mode preset1. Single Color On Steady2. Single Color Breathing (Brightness increases and fades like breathing.)3. Gamer Mode (Specific keys frequently used in video games are color coded.)4. Color Rotation (Keyboard is all one color, which then fades to the next color, and so on.)5. Single Key Light Up (Each key briefly lights up with a random color when you press it.)6. Single Color River (One color ripples across the keyboard.)7. Random Color Snake (All keys start unlit. Then starting at the top left, keys begin lighting up with a random color. This goes to the end of the first row, then drops down to the second row and comes back, then drops down again and goes back to the right and so on. Then they are unlit the same way, but backwards up the keyboard. Repeat.)8. Keypress Ripple Mode (Ripples of random color spread out from each key you press.)9. Neighbor Mode (Keys adjacent to the one you press will briefly light up with a random color.)10. Rainbow River (A rainbow of all the colors ripples across the keyboard. Slow to lowest speed to freeze current placement.)More info on gamer mode: There are five presets, you can select them by hitting Fn+1 through Fn+5.Use Fn+Home to enter reprogram mode. Then, press the key you want to change the color of. Keep pressing it to cycle through all the colors, or to turn it off. When you’re done, use Fn+Home to exit reprogramming mode.Note: Gamer mode doesn’t support turning off ALL the keys. If you use one of the Gamer presets to turn all keys off, they will remain off as long as you stay with that preset. If you go to another Gamer Preset or another mode entirely, when you come back to that preset, it will have reset itself to what it was when the keyboard shipped. You must have at least one key lit up for your changes to save permanently.That said, this is an easy way to cycle through static (not animated) views. I have one Gamer preset with all the lights on in one color, one Gamer preset with all the lights off (except one), and one Gamer preset with actual game keys lit up (which I may not ever actually use). This way I can pick a setting with a couple of taps, rather than cycling through all ten modes. I don't intend to use any of the animated modes; while pretty, they're way too distracting.Last note, when the keyboard arrived, the logo plaque wasn’t stuck on above the arrow keys like it was supposed to be. I picked it up and peeled off the protective plastic, with the intent of then pushing the logo plate into its spot on the keyboard. But when I pulled off the protective plastic film, the logo was sticky on top. So I thought maybe it was better to just leave it off entirely.",

    "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n Like the title says, I have been using this keyboard daily for a year and 4 months. Bought it in Nov 2021. I like it a lot. For those saying the keys stick or don't feel like cherry switches I think maybe you just got a bad one because this thing is still going strong for me. I work from home 100% and use this keyboard for 8-9 hours a day for work and then to game for a few hours a week. I love the color options, the clicky clacky noise, the number pad, and that it is corded so I never have to change batteries.Somethings I have noticed that could be considered cons are:-After a year I started to notice the cord that connects to the keyboard has started to bend and there might be a pinched wire in it now. Sometimes when I move the keyboard around my desk it will disconnect and then reconnect. Sometimes I have to move the cord around to get it to turn back on. So I am going to need to buy a new cord sometime soon. I might see if I can reach out to the company for a replacement. But it works well enough that I've had this problem for a few months and haven't found the need to get a new one  yet.- It isn't the most ergonomic unless you also use a wrist rest. Typing out this review has fatigued my hand muscles a little because I'm not using a wrist rest. That being said I have never found a keyboard that has been super comfortable without a rest.-This one isn't really a con to me but, when playing online games with friends I have to use push to talk because my key sounds are SO loud that it interferes when I use open mic. Now I say this isn't really a con because most of the time I use push to talk but if I'm in discord with an open mic I have to mute myself. I have tried many different headphones and microphones to help prevent this but it always seems to be too loud. But hey, I bought this keyboard because I love the sound of it so this isn't even really a problem to me.All of this being said, I love this keyboard and I would absolutely buy it again if it died. I think that if you want a mechanical keyboard with fun colors for not a crazy price this is the one for you. I liked it so much I bought it for my mom who has arthritis and needs more space between keys to type and she loves it too.",

The lights are so bright and you can adjust the brightness settings as well! I was looking for a keyboard since my spouse and I are slowly upgrading our gaming pc and overall revamping our desk area. This will be great and even hooks up to the Nintendo Switch! I’m not sure about other consoles but I’m assuming that they will since it uses a USB port. I’m VERY satisfied!",

    "I purchased this as an novice keyboard enthusiast wanting to modify her first keyboard. I was looking for cheap options in case it didn't turn out to be my thing. The blue switches this board came with were very difficult to remove without breaking them. I tried using the switch puller it came with but I wasn't able to get the switches out easily. I eventually had to result to prying them out with a flathead screwdriver. Luckily, I don't plan on using these blue switches again so I didn't have to worry about breaking them. It was quite frustrating and a little disappointing. Other than that, the keyboard works well. The lights are beautiful and it operates wonderfully with the new switches and keycaps I purchased for it.",

    "Best Keyboard for clumsy people who eat 'al desko'!!!",
    "Best keyboard for the price. I do not understand why people spend $100+ for keyboards when this one has all of the features those have, and more!This keyboard is the most reliable keyboard out there due to it's ease of maintainence.Let me preface this by saying that I have ruined nice keyboards before by spilling some nasty, sugary drink on them before.I had the misfortune of having an accident with this keyboard before as well. However, a great feature that I fell ALL keyboards should include, ESPECIALLY if they are charging $100+ is FULLY REMOVABLE KEY SWITCHES! Most mechanical keyboards have the switches that are soldered to the main board. Which means when a liquid is spilled on the keyboard, there is no way of removing the dirt or replacing dead keyswitches. You are forced to live with a partially functioning keyboard that smells and has an ant colony living in it (I know, it happened to me before. It was GROSS) or you have to throw that expensive fancy keyboard in the trash. This keyboard allows for the removal of the key switches which means that every single component can be cleaned and repaired/replaced, including the main board itself! An added bonus to the removable switches is the fact that they can be swapped in for any other type of key switch made from other brands. You are not stuck with the Otemu Blue switches included with the keyboard in case you want to try out other styles(They are however very quality switches which are rated for long term use and are better feeling than Cherry MX Blue switches in my opinion). Another quality feature is the fact that the cable can be removed from the keyboard. The cord that comes with the keyboard is decent in quality and length, but it can be swapped out for a high quality Micro-USB cable you use to charge your phone with if desired.Build quality is also another very notable attribute of this keyboard.For $50 one would expect the build quality to be rather cheap, however, this is not the case.The back plate itself is made of aluminum, which gives the keyboard a quality look and feel.However, while the back plate may be made of aluminum, the body of the keyboard is made of plastic.I would have preferred if the housing was aluminum as well, however that would likely be much more expensive to manufacture and this keyboard would no longer cost $50The plastic itself however seems to be a rather sturdy and thick type of plastic that preserves rigidity while conserving weight, unlike an all aluminum housing.Rubber feet were placed on the bottom of the keyboard which helps with stabilization and prevents the keyboard from moving when typing.It also includes small stands that fold out which also have rubber on the bottom to prevent movement. While these stands are reliable, they seem loose and tend to fold back into the keyboard when the unit is pushed with a decent force.The RGB lighting itself is very beautiful and can be toggled to 10 different lighting modes, Brightness and speed.The lighting is not the best on the market however due to the color being limited 7 different colors, as opposed to others which can display the full color spectrum. While this may be a bother to some, I am completely satisfied with the lighting as it still looks great.One gripe I had with this keyboard was the fact that the cord can be unplugged rather easily, leading to accidentally unplugging your motherboard.However, I remedied this be fitting the wire through the included grooves at the bottom of the keyboard. Very nice feature.Also included in the box is a small bag containing 5 new key switches, a keycap and keyswitch removal tools. Very nice touch!!!Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this keyboard to anyone looking for a high quality keyboard for a very reasonable price. While I bought this keyboard with the intention of using it for gaming, being a college student who has to type many papers, this keyboard is parsecs ahead of normal membrane dome keyboards or laptop chiclet keyboards and is pleasant to type on due to its mechanical nature.",

    "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n These are my first mechanical keyboards and I LOVE THEM! I bought 2: one for home, and one for the office.My home unit worked great right out of the box. It was easy to program and in early September 2021, it had no issues with drivers support at all. Flawless! Solid, feedback-giving clicks and a nice even tone when clicked. Even the space bar feels awesome! Note: I am barely a platinum SC2 protoss player and mostly use a controller for FPS games, so I don’t put “heavy strain” on my keyboards and mice. For casual gamers, this is great.My work unit had some issues. It was “missing” keystrokes. For instance, if I typed “thanks,” it would skip the N and I’d end up with “thaks.” It would do this intermittently and almost every other word. It wasn’t as if specific keys were problematic. I think there must have been a short in the pcb under the keyboards. But at first, since I was new to mech keyboards, I thought that I needed practice with them. Or that it needed to be broken in. Nope. I type between 75-90 wpm and work in IT admin so the practice and breaking in period shouldn’t have been an issue. So one of the two I ordered was just a lemon. I contacted Amazon support, even past my return window, and they were gracious enough to help me out with a return. I told them I didn’t want a refund. I just think I got a dysfunctional unit and wanted a replacement. They sent me a barcode for return to UPS and told me a new unit was already on the way. Two weeks later, the replacement works perfectly and I have 2 fantastic keyboards. Nice work Amazon!Note: a mechanical keyboard doesn’t make you a better player. I still suck at starcraft 2.Check out my videos for a demo, including “clicky clacky sounds.”Pros: bright leds, lots of program modes, nice solid keys, great feedback from typing.Cons: I got a lemon, but Amazon customer support made it right. The key picker tool could theoretically damage the plastic on the keys if you need to service them, so be careful. Thoroughly function-check your device when you get it. If it’s not working perfectly, first check your drivers. Then do a full system restart. Then try a number of keyboard accuracy tests. Give it a “break in” period. DO NOT modify it, including applying lubricants, to the switches, before contacting customer service. And don’t wait too long to ask for a replacement. Glhf!",

SO, tried this out because I liked the old-school typewriter look and (wanted) to believe the reviews. OK, so the build is pretty basic, but the RGB light functions are really good, and the switches are exactly what you paid for. NOTE: If you go for this throwback it really is like the old typewriter, so be prepared that you need to type with p-r-e-c-i-s-i-o-n. I would NOT recommend this version for gamers.",

    "Very good except for non-standard Gaote-Outemo Switches",
    "This minimalist design mechanical keyboard has most of the features that I have been looking for.  It's basically a white and silver clone of the Reddragon K556.  At this low price point, it's hard to ask for more.  If it had standard pin pattern switches, it'd be exactly what I wanted.  If you have no intention of changing out the included blue switches, consider this a 5-star keyboard for this price point.Things not included but also not expected due to price: Detachable cable, braided cable, more backlight color flexibility (8 fixed colors vs. higher end chroma offerings), USB pass-through/hub for mouse dongle.Pros:  8-color backlighting with several lighting modes and ability to assign colors to specific keys, MX-compatible switches (big improvement over the ALPS-compatible switches that come with the E-Element Z-77), CIY switches for flexibility (also a con - see below), build quality seems solid, surface mount LEDs.Cons: This manufacturer keeps using Gaote-Outemo switches (this keyboard ships with blues) with a non-standard pin pattern,  That means you can only swap in Gaote-Outemo switches with this specific oddball pin pattern rather than any other aftermarket switch you might want to use such as offerings from Cherry, Gateron, Kaihua, and Outemo (yeah, other aftermarket Outemo's will not fit - personally verified).  This seems like a pretty silly choice for a keyboard marketed as \"Change it Yourself\"/highly customizable.  I'm glad they at least switched over to MX-compatible stems to enable a much wider aftermarket keycap selection, but adopting a standard pin pattern on the PCB to allow for using standardized aftermarket switches from a variety of manufacturers would be fantastic.  Also, the included metal tool for used for pulling the CIY switches must have been designed by a sadist (or more likely not really designed at all).  It has fairly sharp edges and left my fingers pretty bruised and blistered after pulling 208 switches (104 browns from donor the keyboard and 104 blues from this keyboard).  I hope a more ergonomic version of this tool becomes available in the future.I swapped in a set of Gaote-Outemo brown switches scavenged from a Redragon K556 because I prefer browns to blues.  I also swapped in a set of aftermarket keycaps because I don't really like the font on the included keycaps.Keyboards I have personally confirmed to be equipped with non-standard pin pattern Outemo-Gaote switches:E-Element Z-77 (blue switch with ALPS stem) (\nE Element Mechanical Eagle Z-77 Programable RGB Backlit Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, 104 Keys No Conflict, with DIY Blue Switches,Wrist Rest (white)\n)Redragon K556: (brown switch with Cherry stem) (\nRedragon K556 RGB LED Backlit Wired Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Aluminum Base, 104 Standard Keys\n)E-Element X-2000: (this keyboard, blue switch with Cherry stem)Thus far, I have only found blue versions of the Gaote-Outemo switches (both ALPS and cherry stems) available here on Amazon for purchase in 10-packs for $9 each (\nGAOTE OUTEMU Mechanical Keyboard Replaceable Blue Switches,[+] shape (10 PCS)\n).  If you want another kind of switch, you have to find a donor keyboard that has them.  You might want to just buy a donor keyboard for blue switches as well since it will be cheaper than buying the 10-packs.Photo legend:1) As-received E-Element X-20002) As-received side view3) Detail showing backside of removed Gaote-Outemo blue switch and corresponding pin holes in PCB4) First substituted Gaote-Outemo brown switch (courtesy of a sacrificial Redragon K556) in place5) Keyboard with aftermarket keycaps (silver shine-through - https://www.massdrop.com/buy/34313) and brown switches installed6) Workstation looking classy and ready for action",

    "This is the 4th keyboard I have tried, and researched a couple dozen.  I got so frustrated, I tried and then returned the past two.THIS one I am keeping!  It is a little more cost than others, but not as much as many other premium keyboards.I love the keys switches.  I got the Blue key option.  Prefect resistance, and just the right amount of click.Where this really shines is the backlighting.  Each key has it's own LED, and the control options are nice.  The LEDs are bright, and the key caps are clear enough to see the letters perfect (I'm old and losing my sight).  I love the static mode where each key is a different color.  The font on the keys is cool, looks great and different, but still very clear to see.  And the little added touch of the LED dimming, for a split second when it's pressed, is cool!The build is solid.  It has just the right weight.  The deck is plastic but firm, with a nice chrome metal trim around the outside.  It feels so solid that inside the plastic must be a metal frame.  I like how the deck is also just a smidgen larger than the keys.  I have a tight space in my keyboard draw.  It is just small enough to fit on the draw and leave room for the mouse pad.  My choices in purchasing keyboards were first limited by those 17.1\" or smaller, which this is.Although this is a gaming keyboard, I can't comment on that, since I am not a gamer.  But the key click would be nice, I am sure.  It looks awesome so fitting for a tricked out rig.  And there are many backlit options for gaming, turning off and on different key LEDs for different game's keyboard layouts.I use it for web development and multimedia editing.  The keyboard is the center of my work day.  This feels perfect.  The backlit options and the key font are perfect for a dimmed light environment.  It allows me to adjust to the perfect settings for my use.After much research, and many purchases, I can easily say that is one of the best keyboards out there for the money.  Pay less, and it is cheap.  And you'll have to pay a lot more to get better.",

    "We got this for my son's 10th birthday. I will say the package it comes in is NOT gift worthy. My son doesn't care about packaging, though, so that was not a concern. However, if you're looking for a keyboard that looks \"giftable\" in a nice box/package, this is NOT it.The keyboard itself is fantastic. Relatively speaking, this is a cheap mechanical keyboard. But it actually seems really well-made and the features are well-thought-out. No complicated software for changing RGB settings and profiles--EVERYTHING is done via the keyboard itself. Very, very nice. He/we have only used the preset RGB options and haven't done the set-each-individual-key-to-its-own-color but that sounds like a great feature. (I don't have the patience for that, but I know plenty of folks who would love to do that.)We got the white keyboard (\"white gaming keyboard\" was his only request) with red switches. It's very nice and he loves it. I have a few mechanical keyboards (Razer, Logitech, and Corsair) between work and home and this is just as nice as those. Only time will tell in terms of longevity but even if this just last a few years, you can buy 2-3 of these for the price of one of the name brands anyway.Oh! The keyboard cable is detachable! That is a high-end feature that I didn't expect on a keyboard in this price range. (None of mine have that, sheesh.) No, this doesn't magically make the keyboard wireless, but it does mean if the cable (or its USB connector) gets damaged you can replace the CABLE without replacing the entire KEYBOARD. Very nice and unexpected. (I see it's mentioned in the description but I hadn't noticed prior to purchasing, so it was a surprise to me. My son was not excited, but he will be if he just needs to buy a $3 cable in the future instead of replacing the entire keyboard.)The LED brightness is adjustable so you can have it as bright or dim (or off) as you want. Being ten years old, my son keeps the brightness cranked up. It's bright.No hesitations in recommending this keyboard to anyone looking for an affordable mechanical RGB keyboard.",

    "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n This keyboard is sooo beautiful and satisfying! I wanted something that was super clicky, and this definitely hits the mark. It has so many lighting features, which I love. For every feature, you can change the brightness, speed, and color. I change up the settings all the time, and I never get bored. One minor flaw is there is a slight metal reverberation upon typing. The metal face of the keyboard looks good, but it causes the reverberation. I got used to it after a couple days, and now I don’t even notice it. I’ve heard this is a common problem in mechanical keyboards. Another flaw that is more annoying is that the bottom of the keyboard is uneven, causing it to tilt back and forth while typing, similar to how a table with uneven legs will tilt. I put a credit card under the uneven side, which solves the problem, but this, coupled with the metal reverberation sound, caused me to take a star off my review. For reference, I got the blue switch. I also bought this for my home office and not for gaming. I am a writer and the keys can get a little loud when I’m typing quickly. I’ve never had a mechanical keyboard before, and I think looking back I might have preferred a brown switch since they are a little less loud than the blue. Overall though, I am really happy with this purchase. It makes work a little more fun!",

    "Good mod keyboard (using for Mac)",
    "I purchased this keyboard as a new mechanical for my Mac. Yes, it is a \"windows\" keyboard, but some free open source software let me remap MOST of the keys. The main function key is used to activate all of the backlight functions and changes - not a huge deal at all. The fact that I have a \"Mac\" keyboard for a fraction of the other Mac boards is worth the two odd keys.The \"blue\" switches are comparable to Cherry MX and Kailh blues, but I didn't find them to be especially loud. I wanted firmer switches, so I swapped them out for Kailh Jades, but the keyboard as it came was perfectly good. Take care pulling the switches if you do swap - metal pullers can easily scratch the finish.The board is attractive with a nice silver finish and white doubleshot keys which let the colors shine through. The multicolor backlights give you a lot of options, which is also great. A really decent mod platform.I don't particularly love the modern style font of the keys (nor do I like the side by side rather than stacked things (such as the \"1\"-key having: \"1!\" rather than the ! above the 1), but again, that's a style preference more than a flaw and new keycaps to customize the look are easy to find.The keyboard also has tilt feet to change the angle of the keyboard, though they are not particularly tall.As long as the board doesn't crap out on me, this was an excellent find.",

    "Good quality keyboard if you do a lot of typing",
    "This is only my second mechanical keyboard, but I'm really impressed. I have the red switch version, and the typing action is wonderfully smooth with no artificial clicks (which I don't like). The base feels good and sturdy and overall the whole thing feels like a high quality piece of equipment. Not bad at all, for the price. I wish that there were an option to make the RGB lights just pure white, or some of the motion lighting effects to be in a single color rather than rainbow, but overall, the lighting options are good. Overall, I'm really happy with this keyboard.",

    "Great budget mechanical keyboard with lots of customization!",
    "Overall, the keyboard performs well and is super customizable. The keyboard comes with some replacement switches and the tools to remove key caps and key switches. The keyboard is comfortable to use there are two small legs that fold out from under the keyboard to put it at a more ergonomic angle, but if that isn't your preference they fold away underneath the keyboard. It is pretty quiet for a mechanical keyboard since it had the linear switches without tactile feedback or the clicking sound. The linear switches are also nice and smooth.Keyboard Case/Frame:I really like the profile of the case. While the keyboard comes with square key caps, the case is flat and the switches sit on top of the case without framing the square key caps. This was ideal for me since I was looking to replace my key caps with round retro typewriter caps (photo included of the keyboard with replaced key caps).Key Caps and Key Switches:The key caps that come with the keyboard are super comfortable and if RGB lights are your thing they show the lights well. Also there are 13 light settings and 7 color setting to adjust to your ideal color and preference.The key switches are Outemu switches, so they have a different prong pattern from the Cherry MX switches. So if you are looking to upgrade to Cherry MX switches you would need a different circuit board. But the actual switch profile is the standard plus shape and is compatible with most mechanical key cap brands, making it super easy to customize to your ideal desk aesthetic.",

    "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n I just opened this thing out of the box and hooked it up so maybe I will have to change my review later if something unfortunate happens to it.First, it's very easy to set up, no drivers or nothing, just plug it into a working usb port on your computer and you are ready.There is no on-screen editor or whatever you want to call it, so you can manually mess with all the colors and keys on the board, its all something done with various key presses.There are 9 different modes and 5 different gaming type presets already. So pressing FN +1-5 will change the gaming present while pressing FN + INS will change through the 9 modes, which I have uploaded a video of the 9 modes to see.One of the first things I noticed setting this up is how stiff and sturdy the keyboard props on the bottom seem to feel. I always have an issue with those things breaking or just closing back up on their own on other keyboards, but that doesnt seem like itll be an issue on this keyboard. Infact, I had to use a cutical pusher to get the keyboard prop up off the back of the keyboard to use initially.The wire is completely removeable, but I dont think the keyboard can be wireless as there is no sort of \"antenna\" you plug into the computer nor do you get one with it. There are nice grooves along the bottom of the keyboard for the wire to be fed through as well, straight out the back center, or down the left or right side .It is extremely clicky. I happened to get the white keyboard with the blue switches and I am not at all dissapointed in the amount of clickyness I have from this, nor do I feel like I need more. Plenty clicky (I know people hunt that out specifically). Its even got a nice click bump deal before bottoming out the key :)The top of the keyboard has a nice shiny brushed metal type plate that runs along the entire top giving it a really nice sleek design and extra durability in the board...although I dont feel like these things are used in a manner that would need something to prevent them from being...essentially broken in half....but I imagine that metal plate would help.Overall, I feel really good about the keyboard out of the box. It has so many different color options and modes its so cool, just like I wanted. I love the clicky mechanicalness of it all and now I just wait to see how long it will last me! Hopefully years!",

I got used to the keys right away and It's light and easy to move around, and even nice to look at!! the base board has this nice matt metallic surface that will slightly reflect the LED light and there is a thin glossy metallic edge on the base board, it really nice and so much options for the LED colors!!!The only issue -- and it's probably just because I am new to machinal keyboard -- is that when I am playing some games where it's very space-bar-heavy, my thumb would start to hurt because I have to constantly press space-bar with the side of my thumb, I wonder if changing the key cap will help??But overall, it's a product I don't regret buying!

    "Good keyboard, kind of loud, paying for flash.",
    "I just got my keyboard a couple of days ago. And I gotta say, I was definitely taken in by the flashy colors. If I had to get a keyboard again, I would probably go with a more basic mechanical keyboard with quieter switches and either very basic white LED backlighting, or none at all. (Turns out you don't actually stare at your keyboard when using your computer) The Outemu blue switches are loud, and after just 2 days, I'm looking into how much it would be to replace my switches with cherry browns or reds (looks like it would be close to the price of the keyboard itself...) And the cord is a little bit thicker than I'd like. It's just a little stiff and doesn't go behind my desk without putting up a little fight.That said, I think this is a very good keyboard. I do really like the clickiness of the buttons with the blue switches (and I think brown switches keep that while not making as much noise), and I am enjoying the color settings, it's just kind of gimmicky.The overall quality of the keyboard seems pretty impressive. It's sturdy, has a nice heavy feel, and takes up SO MUCH LESS SPACE than my previous keyboard (though that's to be expected when you cut a wrist rest and like 12 macro buttons). I'm also really happy with the keycaps themselves; because this is an RGB keyboard, for the lights to shine through on the keys, the letters are not printed on the keys, but actually part of the key. That means I won't be rubbing them off after repeated use (managed to wipe away the w, z, x, n, k, and tab keys on my last keyboard).My suggestion: look at the Velocifire VM01 keyboard. It's $40, still back-lit (though not RGB, it's all 1 solid color, and seriously, that's fine.), and that one has brown switches (quieter, still tactile, my honest preference here). The cord on that one seems kind of rigid too, and doesn't come out the middle, but offset in the back, so watch that. If you don't need the number pad, or you just prefer a tenkeyless board, the Velocifire TK01 is the one for you, and it's $30, 10 less than the bigger one, and just above half the price of this one.I don't regret buying this keyboard, but a little more research and I probably would've gone with the VM01. It's the switches, man.",

    "I'm really happy that I made the decision to buy this keyboard instead of shelling out a bunch of cash for a more expensive one. Honestly one of the reasons I came to write this review is so that I could spend some time typing on it. I enjoy the convenience of being able to adjust the different light settings from the keyboard itself as opposed to as software program which most RGB keyboards on the market seem to have. This made it super easy for me to use with my Macbook because most of the time the software isn't compatible with iOS. (If you're looking for a keyboard to use with a Mac this doesn't have the option and command keys but if you're not picky about that it works great.)The one thing I wish was a little more customizable is the gaming settings - there seems to be only one option for the backlight color (white) and none of the other keys are lit in any of the options. I would have liked to be able to make the backlight different colors like you can when you're using the regular backlight for the full keyboard, as well has have the ability to make the whole keyboard backlight and have the gaming keys appear as a different color.Other than that, there's enough backlight modes that I'm thoroughly entertained, and I honestly would have given this a 4.5/5 if I could.",

    "Honestly the lights , in my opinion, are the best part of this keyboard. They are super bright and super pretty. However, not everyone is just here for the colors. Considering that is it a bit hard to find a white, chroma, full key bard that looks good, this is pretty okay.  I have had it set up with my new PC for about a week and I have run into a slight problem. While playing games the wsad are the common keys. W typically meaning to go forward however at times when playing games the w key seems to not work. As I am only able to move side to side. Since I am not a heavy gamer it is annoying but it's not something I'm pulling my hair for. However, I could see how it could be a MAJOR issue for pro gamers. I will not be returning it for the fact that it's something I could live with until I could afford a better keybaord. Therefore do what you will with that information. (ps-keep in mind that my keyboard could just be defective since I don't see many people experiencing the same issue. I guess you'll never know till you try it yourself, however do be cautious)",

    "I've had this keyboard for ~ 3 years. I am a computational chemist and a heavy gamer and, therefore, spend a lot of time on this keyboard for both work and gaming purposes. I am writing this review because I finally had a key die on me. The \"Win\" key of all keys. Possibly just bad luck since I do not use this key as much as other keys. But, the keyboard is very easy to disassemble to clean and diagnose. The switch for the dead key is a pain to get into without the right tools.This keyboard is a bit on the cheaper side. All keys sway just a little on day 1. After 3 years of vigorous usage, I cannot say with 100% certainty if the magnitude of sway increases, but I've had a few rare occurrences of \"fat fingering\" neighboring keys on this keyboard that non-switch keyboards as the years go by. However, the switch's clicks are always satisfying and just as responsive as the first day I got this keyboard. This is by far not the brightest keyboard on the market. However, it is perfect for working at night. The RGB on this keyboard has been on for effectively 3 years straight. All lights work to this date!tldr; It is cheap, but it works. There is better out there, sure, but not for this price. It took 3 years of beating before I had my first real issue.",

However, I quickly adapted to it.One of the things that I really like about it is the sound. It isn't a loud clicking like my Daskeyboard. It's more muted, but very satisfying...if that makes sense. The engineer loves hers now too. She also had a bit of an adjustment phase. We also both LOVE the backlighting and how easy it is to adjust.The only negative I have is that it has a harder edge than I like. You will definitely need a gel pad to keep your hands from hurting, especially if you do a lot of typing...which we both do.Overall this is a great mechanical keyboard for the price. They can get pretty expensive, so if you're looking for a reasonably priced item to see if you will like a mechanical, this is the one. I will update a few months down to road to provide insights into how durable it ends up being. It will take a lot of abuse from me since typing is all I do day in and day out.",

    "Unmatched value in mechanical keyboards",
    "Description:Full-size keyboard. Metal plate on plastic housing. Keyswitches are mounted to top plate with no frame/bezel. Non-removable USB cable (grey plastic, NOT braided).Key Switches:I purposely chose this keyboard due to the use of Outemu blue switches. I desired this switch based on the force curves I compared on input club (input.club/the-comparative-guide-to-mechanical-switches/tactile-clicky/). Some keyboard experts claim that the Outemu switches are louder than Cherry MX, but I think it matters little when choosing a clicky (blue) switch. The sound of the space bar press/release has a unique sound and some may find it annoying, but I can live with it. This is a joy to type on. I like the tactility and click of these Outemu blue switches. I've also spent hundreds of hours typing Cherry MX browns, Topre, White Alps, and Kailh blues and this keyboard is one of my favorite for typing.Keycaps:The keycaps seem to be some sort of double-shot, white and clear. These seem like a better quality keycap than the typical backlit keyboards which have a clear keycap which is coated in black which can wear off and leave you with ugly see-through tops.Other comments:This keyboard doesn't feel very heavy, but is extremely rigid (due to the metal top plate). The instruction book is in Chinese, but I was able to find some youtube reviews to learn the different lighting modes. I really like that this model has no logo or insignia on the top plate. Even the lock light labels are very simple/subdued. At the time of this writing, this keyboard is on sale for $51.99 which is probably one of the best prices I've seen for a keyboard of this quality. The keyboard came with a keypuller, switchpuller, and a few spare Outemu blue switches. The only thing I don't like is the keycap font. I think it may appeal to some, but I think it looks like it is \"trying too hard\" to be cool.",

I think if I had it to do over again I would have just bought a bunch of cheap microsoft wired keyboards and just thrown them away as they wore out.The result of the grease feels mushy and the tactile bump is even less perceptible than it was.

    "Well I bought this to compare this one with the \"glorious modular\" keyboard, to see the why the price different, and well right out of the box I can say the LED are a bit better, or maybe that just a placebo effect...because i prefer newer stuffs ;P, it's not corsair level though. The glorious keyboard LED rely on their glossy keycap to reflect light, and they have some weird color choices installed on there as well. However, I do believe that the glorious have more lighting effect option, both have the same amount of user customize option, just not the one I'm looking for that apparently only the Drevo Calibur had for this price point.Both have removeable Switches, so you can replace them depend on your reference, but the Glorious keyboard does not come with extra switches like this one, but i guess that is a bit subjective. Downside is this only come standard with Blueoutemu switches, would be nice to see more switch option add in. Also, i do believe that this keyboard is only able to fit Outemu switches, and possible Cherry MX. Anyways most people prefer gateron, because of their smoothness, I am not the expert at telling the different..I like both, but if i have to compare I would  say the outemu have more resistance? I could be wrong though. The only reason why this keyboard is less than the Glorious keyboard, is because of their gateron switches, and it build quality, and possibly 2-4 more lightings preset option. Other than those, both keyboards have the same generic minimalist exterior build, but I do believe Glorious keyboard have a nicer build and sturdier, E-element feel, and seem.....eh budget, but it does have a removable cable, so if you do not like the stock cable you can alway replace it with a nice braided one, the glorious keyboard just come attached with a braided cable.Conclusion: It's great keyboard for the price, build quality need to be improved, because the edge have opening, and it is some what sharp. Also, both keyboard definitely could use a volume roller, but that is just my reference, because I dislike the ideas of having to use FN then reach for the F1-2 for volume up, and down, but The glorious keyboard minimize the reach by placing them on F9-F11, to shorten the distance.--Glorious for build quality, fit gateron switches, and possible every other switches as well.--E-element(z88) detachable cable, water resistance, and more budget friendly.",

The keys have a satisfying click, but it's nowhere near as loud as my last (blue switch) mech with these brown switches. I know it's gotta be fairly durable because the case is metal and it came in just a simple cardboard box stuck in an un-padded poly mailer. (I'm gonna say that packaging leaves a little to be desired, but not enough to knock a star off.) The RGB is vibrant and bright, and it's got several modes to switch between.I don't think you can go wrong, really.",

I have already replaced two faulty switches.The keybord itself is fine, the colors do not persist if the keyboard is unplugged which is a minor annoyance, but after only 3 months the switches started to fail. The switches are swappble as advertised, but they take so much force to remove that the switch puller included with the board is not sufficient and it bent my other switch puller. Within a week three switches all started to fail on different parts of the keyboard. At this point it would cost more than the entire keyboard did to replace all the switches. Give it a pass.",

    "Great keyboard! Amazon Prime made it come in two days which made it even better!Pros-Nice, Mechanical keys.The feel you get whenever you type, or play a game. With a slight touch you move, for games like CS:GO this is a much for me personally!The RGB is able to do truly beautiful work, and seems like it can do more colors than I thought originally. (I had a cheap $20 keyboard that was RGB but only did two modes. Still and pulse, and only Red, blue and green. This blows that keyboard outta the water for sure!)The modes you can choose, and are able to do. Controls are FN + INS key for different modes, and FN + DEL key for the different colors if the certain mode allows.Cons-Beyond loud! I mean if I went into the other room, I could probably still hear the typing (Actually just outside of the door, not the other room) but none the less, the keys are loud. I'm currently listening to music with noise cancelling headphones and can still hear the keys as I'm typing right now as that can get annoying for some much like it does for me.There's no program to control certain keys to turn certain colors and such. (I'd like to make it do a rainbow effect with only blue, white and red)Truly a 10/10 keyboard, I'd highly recommend as long as you can deal with the keys being loud as heck! And not being able to control the modes for RGB to do certain things.",

Nice typing feel but noisy as you would expect.  It lacks any multimedia keys, instead relying on a FN button to make the Function keys do extra functions.  But I'm not discounting it for that since it's clear it doesn't have those in the listing, just something I would have liked.I really like the illumination, large characters, very bright, great if you want a keyboard you can see in the dark and don't have good eyesight.  I have RP and I can see everything fine.The cable detaches so is replaceable, USB A to USB C.  Can be routed left, right, or straight out the back.

    "This is my second keyboard from this manufacturer, this time with RED switches. The Blue switch-model is clicky and a bit louder, I like both, but growing more towards the RED switches one as it (in my believe) types a bit faster and not as loud. However, I love both the same. The LED light effects are a great bonus if you are into it, or if you work in a dark room. I can use this at home with no issues while all lights are turned off (not that I am looking at the keys anyways but yeah). The effects are easy to use or even to turn off if so required.The only issue I have would be that it could use a Second \"Windows\" key on the right hand side of the layout but not to take a Star off for it, I knew that before walking into the purchase, as mentioned I already own this keyboard with blue Switches.If you want an amazing mechanical keyboard with LED effects for an affordable price and great quality go no further, this is what you looking for.If you like mechanical with not so much Clickyness then go RED, if you like the clicky stile and resistance on the input, go with blue.Hope that helps everyone.",

    "Here's my pros and cons of the E-Element Z-88 RGB Mechanical Gaming Keyboard. I have the \"Brown\" switch model in all white.Pros:Anit-Ghosting works as advertised.The feel and sounds of each key press sound very similar to Cherry MX Browns.Chamfered edges and aluminum front plate.The feet on the back have a non-slip rubber on them. (all four corners have a non-slip rubber on them)Budget friendly.RGB LEDs with multiple modes and adjustable brightness/color.I can't speak on the longevity of the keycaps but they feel high quality.You are able to route the cable for the keyboard to the left, right, or center for cable management.Minor branding above the arrow keys.Cons:My unit came with cosmetic scuffs about the num pad. Very small though and doesn't bother me at all.They yellow on my \"H\" key is different from the rest of the yellow LEDs.Ugly keycap font.Overall I believe you will be very happy purchasing this as your first mechanical keyboard. I know looked around a lot to find the right keyboard that fit my budget. Sadly you can't escape the ugly keycap font they used as it's common among cheaper mechanical keyboards. However you can easily purchase a Cherry MX compatible keycaps and switch them out.",

    "I'm happy and impressed with this keyboard so far but I didn't purchase it for gaming--I got sick of turning on the desk lamp every time I wanted to use my computer and the backlit keys on this solve that problem.  The keys have a nice tactile feel although the fact that this keyboard is fairly loud when typing should be a consideration for potential customers with roommates who might not want to make clattery sounds when they use their computer.  The backlight color of the keys can be changed (although it took me a while to figure out how since the INS key above the arrow keys needs to be used rather than the [ ] INS key from the number pad.  The backlight can also be turned completely off (although it took me a couple minutes to figure out how to turn the backlight back on since there are no explicit instructions for doing that) and the intensity of the backlight can also be adjusted.  The keys are nicely spaced and very easy to read.  So far this is exactly what I was looking for--my only concern is durability since this is priced lower than most mechanical keyboards.",

Additional star added for great customer service.ORIGINAL REVIEW---This was my second mech keyboard purchase and the first one set the bar pretty high for me.  I was a bit displeased upon opening the box and finding hairs and some sort of paint marks on my keyboard.  Apparently the QC process is very lacking where these are made.  After cleaning it up I plugged it up and it worked correctly.  I DO like the detachable power cable for this keyboard.  If it ever breaks, it's easy to get a cheap replacement.  The cable routing is also a plus in my book.  The RGB patterns are the standard gamut that comes on most backlit keyboards and the colors look crisp.  The only downside to the Z-88 is that I needed to get a wrist rest.  Which would be fine but a high quality wrist rest costs half as much as this keyboard, so consider that when choosing your options.  If you've already got a wrist rest, then this keyboard isn't a bad option to go with.",

Great bargain keyboard if you don't care about the sound.How to improve:Don't list as silent for one.

There's even a mode wherein you can program individual keys for customized colors. The best part of that is there is no special driver software.

So much fun.Finally, the tactile feel is wonderful. I'm a long time fan of the classic Model-M. This is not quite that, but it is very close. Sound wise, it is still \"loud,\" but it is not quite the clamorous racket maker a Model-M is.My only complaint about it? I hate the font they used for the keys. It's awful.If I was trying to improve it, I would start with the font and then add a USB hub and some touch controls for things like volume.

    "I have had this keyboard since June 2018. I game almost every day and also do a lot of computer work from home and this keyboard had done it all. It looks great, has a very \"apple\" feel with the silver base and white keys. The blue switches are perfect for confirming the keystrokes. The backlight RGB is brilliant and programable. USB connection is easy, and the cord is of good quality.  This is a full size board, wired, and totally awesome. I would buy this again today without ANY hesitation.",

    "Needed a keyboard replacement, quite happy with this.",
    "After my Corsair K70 finally died, I needed something new but cheap, and with Blue switches. Since most keyboards with MAX Cherry switches are usually $100 plus, I found this.So first off, I want to say this arrived semi-broken. Edge of the keyboard is bent up and the Num-Pad key for 9 and - aren't working. I'll try replacing the switch and update review after that.But as for the keyboard itself, I think I can safely say I love this more than my old K70. The keycaps feel nice and not cheap, the switches sound and feel incredible. Better than Cherry, I like to think. And the build quality, aside from the bent edge at the corner, is solid and feels sturdier than my old K70. The LEDs are also beautiful. Clear, bright, and the customization options are quite nice. Would like to do custom profiles like certain bigger brands allow, but it's nice as is.Overall, I'm very happy with this keyboard, but I did have to take off a star for the broken keys and bent corner.Edit: After posting this review, the keys starting working. So only problem now is the bent corned.",

    "Very attractive good keys but lights up even when computer off",
    "I love the appearance of this keyboard and the bounce back on the keys, but it's not perfect. Sometimes the keys lag behind the stroke (that is, the response occasionally lags, or requires a harder press than I have done to register the stroke). The worst thing about this keyboard is it lights up if you hit a key even if the computer is off. I don't know if this is considered a feature and can be turned off (didn't read the manual outside of figuring out which light setting I wanted) but it's very irritating if you have pets.",

    "Looove!! This is the second E-element mechanical keyboard I've purchased (I have the compact version of this keyboard) and the third mechanical back-lit keyboard, because who doesn't need a little awesomeness while typing??I bought this one for my Mom to use for work when her keyboard died., because she loved mine and all the programmable lighting goodness. She was really happy with it and all the lighting choices available, which is a bit more than I have on my two boards. You can select backlight only by hitting FN + ESC and then change the color selection by hitting FN + DEL. You can select different light displays by hitting FN + INS, with loads of options available. Loved how easy it was for my Mom to use, and she is a crazy fast typist who claims that the keys on this board actually made her faster. Now I have keyboard envy, so I'm going to buy one for myself, because this is a great keyboard for the price. Highly recommend!",

    "First time considering Mechanical?",
    "This review will best help the first timer considering mechanical. I am no connoisseur of mechanical boards, as this is MY first, but ill have to say, this z-88 does not disappoint. Until now i have always had used hand me down units with the exception of one Apple MB110LL/B years ago, which i liked a lot.It took about a day to get used to the clickity click sound, which initially i thought was going to be a deal breaker.After that it just got sweeter.... I quickly learned to love the conformation click of each keystroke, and unless you are in an environment where the noise will bother others, I am guessing you will as well.I am not a huge fan of RGB so the multitude of options on this board was one of its major selling points.The quality (for me the first timer) seems really good, sturdy and well put together.I like the minimalist size, and the rubber footed riser legs are a feature that i never knew i was missing. They really keep this board in place.My gaming has improved due to KNOWING when i actually hit a key.... hearing it and feeling it.I wish i had purchased this years ago.",

I got the brown one and level of clickety sound is at a nice pleasant volume - ASMR like.  There are so many effects. Some my favorite ones are when when you hit a key, the rainbow colors spread out or the one where each key lights up only when you hit it.  I like the minimalist white/silver color and chose this keyboard for that reason. I also like the font on the keys, it's Wall-E-ish.  Very fun to use!",

    "Great mechanical keyboard and impressive RGB for the price",
    "This is my first true mechanical keyboard that I got for gaming. I was worried about having to save up 100+ dollars, but this keyboard has a lot of great features and feels great, especially for the price. It has the satisfying click that you are looking for and an easy to use per-key RGB lighting. The lighting has some limitations but it still includes some cool effects. The design is very small and simple, and the main body feels like it is good quality. However, the eagle emblem above the directional keys had a plastic film over it (like you see on a brand new tv screen, etc.) and the emblem came off when I was trying to peel the plastic. However, the adhesive on the back of the emblem was still strong enough for me to press it on and it is actually in there pretty good now, so maybe it is meant to be minor self assembly?I think it is also nice the usb cable can be disconnected and there are grooves to run it left, right, or center.",

The keyboard comes with all the signs of a cheap knockoff, like the sticker underneath it is mostly in Chinese, and the English section of the manual feels... well, you know what.However, this keyboard is extremely durable, the keys are extremely responsive yet still aren't too sensitive, and the base is sturdy. As far as the lighting goes, it has the various assortment of \"gimmicky\" light presets, but their also is the standard presets, like a slow pulse, or a solid single color. Those presets, which can be customized by their pulse speed, color, and color intensity. The pulse one is specifically my favorite, and I cranked it down to a slow speed, and a nice red glow. The best thing about the lighting, is that it's a comfortable glow, and not a \"in your face, blinded by the light\" deal.All in all, I absolutely got the \"feel\" and then some.",

    "This keyboard is really great. I have used Razer's blackwidow chroma v2 for over a year now, but the blue switches were too loud after a while ,so I was looking for something more quiet. The price for this keyboard is 3 times cheaper then my Razer and I have to say, I enjoy this one better. The switches are very nice to type on and it also looks much more elegant with it's silver and white finish.You also get a replacement kit with a few extra switches and 2 very handy tools to remove the caps. I used the tools to add additional language keyboard stickers on the bottom side (I find it more elegant this way) and the provided tools made it very easy.It arrives with a durable dark gray micro-USB cable. And the cable is detachable, as seen in the picture, so If you'd like a white or silver finish cable you can easily replace it.That's it, Hope this review can be helpful, Good luck.",

I had a Razer Blackwidow Chroma before this keyboard and it was supposedly \"Anti-Ghosting\" and I had a lot of ghosting problems with it even after driver updates. Then i got the 81-key and now the 104-key keyboard and I have had no ghosting problems at since switching. Controlling the RGB effects of the keyboard via the FN Key with combonation of the arrow keys and utility keys is a great way to circumvent annoying propretairy software like Razer Synapse!

There are a lot of backlight options on the keyboard, all accessible without software (Fn + Ins or Del keys).  The only nitpick I have so far is that the backlight is not very bright.  This is due to the individual key LEDs being on the keyboard behind the keyswitch instead of being towards the middle of the keyswitch (the keyswitches are replaceable on this keyboard and it comes with 5 spare red switches).  The keyboard also comes with a switch puller and keycap puller.  The cable is a detachable standard micro USB cable.

Most of the ten effect patterns don't feel like something I could use however.It does have the option for doing custom colors per individual keys, but it requires that  you repeatedly press each key to get to the color you want. When you are in the selection mode it still sends the keystrokes to the computer (I still don't want sticky keys turned on!) which is mildly inconvenient. When you go to set a custom pattern it starts completely over so get it right the first time. The worst aspect is that the keyboard doesn't retain any of your custom patterns or even current selection over a power cycle.

Really cool.The detachable cord makes it easy to switch to a controller for games with gamepad input well as keyboard and mouse input.

I do not use it for games and I selected a uniform white illumination for all keys. It is possible to set key color  individually but to me it was not necessary. Overall it is a huge step above over some standard $10 mushy garbage that is packaged with the desktops.I love it and recommend it highly. But beware of the clicking noise.

    "Typing this review on my (not so new anymore) Z-88 updated mechanical keyboard.  This is my first mechanical keyboard, but I have played around with a friend's who has three or four.  Have to say, I doubt I'll ever go back.  Sure, the keys are loud, but I guess they are kind of meant to be.  What I love about this keyboard so much is that I can change out the switched for Brown clones if I just want the tactile feel as opposed to the noise as well, but you know what, I'm pretty attached to the noise.  Never had a complaint from peers or co-workers, and the backlight and styling are very much to my liking.  I would definitely recommend this board to anyone trying to get into their first mechanical for not too much more than a cheap rubber dome keyboard.",

The colors are absolutely beautiful and it is functioning as it should. The user guide and mannual are pretty self-explanatory for the mechanical keyboard.So if it's anybody else's first time then this is great one to use!Shipping was super fast and came the next day after ordering.",

For 50 bucks, this is a great introduction to mechanical keyboards and I can't see myself getting rid of it anytime soon.

    "Got the 12\" Brown Switch RGB one. Must say its pretty impressive for the price. Switches feel really nice and consistent with a authentic MX Brown Switches. Even though its a compact keyboard the keys are NOT cramped. No tiny spacebar, delete key, backspace etc. And they are properly spaced like a full sized keyboard. The LEDs are pretty dim but thats no big deal. They're nice to have either way. Has a metal back-plate and plastic base so a little extra weight. Mine doesn't slide at all which was a concern. Even comes with 5 extra brown switches and tools if one goes out. My Cooler Master Brown Switch gaming keyboard that cost me 3 times this didn't even come with those.. Nice product E-Element!! I will definitely be a return customer. Very impressive for only $49.",

It has seven colors and multiple modes to choose including multiple rainbow modes. It has gaming presets to light up different parts of the board depending on the games you play regularly.

The font they used is not my favorite but that’s the least of my worries. Light is very bright which I love. Not too loud. I haven’t had any issues with the keys. I would most definitely recommend!!",

    "Absolutely LOVE this keyboard!  I was worried about the gold color for the face.. but honestly I don't even notice it when I sit at my computer.  It seems like it actually brightens the LEDs.  I ended up finding some speakers that match these perfectly too, the HiVi M10s.  They are white and gold as well.  The only downside (to some) would be how loud the keys are.  This is my first mechanical keyboard and I got one to experience that so it's not bothering me.  I feel like this was the best valued purchase of my setup and I would definitely recommend this keyboard to anyone.",

    "Similar to another reviewer's experience, I lovedd this keyboard for around a month, but a couple of weeks ago, the same D key switch has started to fail, only dddetecting certain presses, or duplicating keystrokes and also having a consierably higher pitched/louer 'twang' noise. I took out and changedd the key to see if that would fix it, but the problem is still there. This happene JUST as the return periodd for Amazon expired. I'd like to get some support but apparently there's no contact information about the seller \"Spring in Original\".PS: I left in the D typos as that's how the keyboard recognized the D key as I was writing the review.",

However, it feels no better than a 10 dollar membrane keyboard. We bought the brown switch keyboard. I do not recommend this keyboard at all. If you want neat colors, then go for it. The only reason I am NOT giving it a very low rating is the colors, and it wasn't a lie. I just didn't realize how bad these Outemu  Brown switches really are. Maybe the other switches are better in different ways. These brown keys are garbage.If you feel the 50 dollars justifies the colors, and want a normal 10 dollar keyboard otherwise, go for it.",

    "I could swear this is a membrane keyboard",
    "I've been a user of mechanical keyboards for several years, and I was looking to replace an older one that had finally given out. I figured I'd look for a cheap replacement and try some new things. Instantly upon pressing a key on this keyboard, I was confused because it felt strikingly like a 20$ membrane keyboard from 15 years ago, it's seriously uncanny. Mechanical switches, specifically MX Reds which I've always used, have a very linear and smooth travel. The pressure is totally steady with zero stopping or change in resistance. With this keyboard, after a tiny bit of travel, you hit a barrier that physically feels like a rubber membrane dome, and then you press harder and break through that. I'm not sure what these \"custom\" switches are, but if you want to feel a real mechanical keyboard, find something with Cherry MX, Kailh, or Gateron or one of those other decently reputable switches.",

I've had this keyboard for about 4 months now, and it's worked flawlessly up until now. The keyboard still works, and the same goes for the back-lighting, but my issue lies with the 'D' key. Sometimes I will press it down, making sure it will bottom out completely, and it will not respond, or it would type 2 'D's, so if I were to type something like 'Dot', sometimes it would come out as 'ot', or 'DDot', or, in rare cases, it would type triple, like 'DDDot'. And as the product states that it will live through a tested 50 million keystrokes, it certainly did not meet expectations. I have done research online, and have not yet found a way to solve this problem. Any help would be appreciated.",

I then sit there for a second while the other guy shoots me and have to reclick w to start moving again.  I think this is ghosting which the listing states that its anti-ghosting.

But now at the eight month mark, some of my keys have stopped working on a consistent basis. I can type the same letter over and over again and nothing will show up until I go back and delete a few words and try again. It's completely bizarre, but definitely the keyboard's fault.

    "Bought this for my own computer set up after using my husband's computer for the last few years. He has a Corsair keyboard and while I don't need a gaming keyboard, I like shiny, colorful things! So I searched for a backlit blue switch keyboard and found this. Yes, it's a gaming keyboard and I can see how this is perfect for gaming after using my husband's. The response time is fast. The raised keys are good too. But honestly, I bought it for the backlit colors, no shame lol! The colors and different modes do not disappoint. I love the clicky sound of the blue switches. The pushback on them is nice too, not too rigid. It is very streamlined as well, the functions are easy to use.  I love the price of the keyboard even more! If you want a budget-friendly gaming keyboard, this is it. If you want a cute, backlit, well-priced keyboard, this is it too!",

But the biggest issue I have with it is that, when the lights are on, it makes a high pitched ringing sound which is super weird for a keyboard. I know it's the keyboard since I've turned it on and off several times to make sure. Also one of the keys popped off while I was playing, but that's fine I guess.A few of the keys, mainly enter and backspace, are a little sticky which can be annoyingVery loud keys, which I don't mind, but should be considered.

Very nice tactile feel, something I reallymiss.Pros - nice tactile feel, and feedback to your fingers and ears. backlit with various adjustments good weight, it doesn’t slide around the desk hot swappableCons - needs more backlight adjustment  needs more speed adjustment on the backlight  the instructions pamphlet is ridiculously smallFor $49.97 you can’t go wrong!

The variable key backlighting on the keyboard is probably the most interesting features.

Only it's not really plain ol' backlighting, because you can choose the hue, as well as the intensity.  For me, the must was mechanical.  The keyboard came with \"red\" switches, my preference, and included several replacement switches should any of the switches on the keyboard fail over time.  USB cord is nice and long.  Board boots up to your last saved settings on power up.  At this price, it's definitely a mechanical I'd buy again.

    "I got the version with the blue switches.First of all, I purchased this for work, so let me talk about that before we get to gaming. I realized that I hated typing all day on the standard keyboard that everyone  knows and hates, so I was looking for a mechanical keyboard to give me increased responsiveness and tactile satisfaction. This delivers on both. The fact that it is also really clean looking, with really impressive RGB for the price, is a great bonus. The blue switches have a satisfying sound that is not overly loud for my quiet office environment. I truly think it was louder typing on the old Dell keyboard, so don't worry too much about the sound even if you have an open cubicle setting, unless your office currently operates on the super low-profile slim keyboards (with flat keys like a laptop); any raised keys are going to be loud in comparison. The blue switches give more of a *click* or *snap* than a *clack* sound. It's like if a traditional typewriter had a softspoken kid. It is substantially quieter (at least in sound quality) than my Corsair K95. Further, it has a standard key layout (including the number pad), which cannot be said for a good portion of keyboards that target gamers.Though I don't use this keyboard for gaming, I do game in general, and think this keyboard is worthwhile for that use as well. If you aren't looking to spend a few hundred on a mechanical keyboard, I seriously think you'll be happy with this. The keys are responsive, the resistance is pretty consistent across all keys, the sound is satisfying, the layout is appropriate for a desk set up, wire placement is convenient, and you don't have to worry about downloading any special software for the RGB. You get the look and essential functionality that you need to have a good looking and good feeling setup. You also get some media function keys. The keyboard as a whole feels quality, not cheap. Try-hards might come and say that it doesn't stack up to pricier keyboards and so shouldn't get a 5 star in that category. I do prefer my Corsair for actual gaming, but if I had never experienced the Corsair, I wouldn't have any complaints about this keyboard. It feels like good quality and you honestly can't beat the price. It has everything you need, and some quality of life and aesthetic bonuses on top of that.In short, for office or for gaming (in this price range), I can't recommend enough.",

    "I am not one to spend a lot of money on peripherals for my system. I know people that spend hundreds on a mouse/keyboard set up and they end up dying after 6 months, and they re-buy the same thing just cause it is brand name.I don't get it. I've never understood it.Even at the relatively cheap price this board was, I almost couldn't convince myself to buy it. But I knew I wanted a mechanical, full size, white board. I had tried another board from another company for about half the price of this one, and I absolutely hated it. I immediately sent it back after one use. The keys just weren't great, the lighting was awful, just a bad board. This one though? Mmmmm.This keyboard is the best keyboard I have ever had. The lighting is absolutely gorgeous, very bright, and very easy and fun to customize. The click-clacks are audible but not obnoxious. I just love it. It's incredibly well built and it fits my white build 100%.If you're on the edge and you know you for sure want a mechanical full size, get this keyboard. You will not regret it.Edit: Lowered down to 4 stars, because I am starting to get intermittent key-repetition, or key chatter as I'm seeing it called. So far it seems to mostly be the \"W\" key, and it doesn't happen a lot, but when you type accurately at 110+ WPM, it throws you off. As of now it isn't a HUGE deal, but I've only owned this keyboard since late April, so not a good sign of longevity. I will update if it gets wworse. <- And yes, that double-w there is exactly what I'm talking about, which ironically (or unironically I guess) just happened to mess up while typing this update. :)This is cheap for a legit mechanical keyboard, and one that has a metal frame, gorgeous lighting, and is splash proof, but it's still expensive for a keyboard, so hopefully this doesn't become an issue.If the problem persists, or at least gets much worse, I will update my review again with less stars, as 6 months is not a good enough lifetime for a $50 keyboard. I guess worst case scenario I will just go back to a membrane keyboard, but I really REALLY like mechanicals.FINAL UPDATE: My key chatter on the W key got much worse, to the point that it was negatively effecting my gaming. It got to the point that I finally sent the seller an email asking them if they could send me new switches, and to my surprise they replied almost immediately and were more than happy to send me new switches. I only asked for a couple, one to replace the W key and one to have as a backup, but they generously sent me a bag of 11, with a keycap puller, and a switch puller. I now have a perfectly functioning W key and an appreciation for this company. :)Update  2/23/22: This keyboard is still working great after almost two years. I have had to replace multiple switches at this point, but it's quick and easy to do so no big deal.",

    "I didn't like the Cheap Low Profile Membrane Keyboard that they provide for work at my workstation.  I was looking for a Budget Mechanical Keyboard which won't break my wallet to bring and use at work.Pros- At $59.99 you can't go wrong. (Cheap)- 104 keys- Red Switches (Good for Quieter office environment)- Textile and Fairly smooth Switches.  Feels good when typing.- Has RGB lighting which can be operate or turn off without Software (By using Standard FN Keys, can easily find instructions online)- Solid and Sturdy Constructions- Has Channel under Keyboard where wires can be routed clean left, right or straight forward.Cons- Although it's a Red Switch, but not as quiet when compared to my Corsair Cherry MX Cherry Red Switch Mechanical Keyboard at home.  Does sound a touch more clicky when compared.  (Once again, you get for what you paid for)- The RGB Lighting Modes is limited- The RGB Lighting looks dim (I don't think it's double shot keys).  Wish it's brighter.Overall a good Budget Mechanical Red Switch Keyboard if you don't have much expectations and only wanted for typing.  Did not use for gaming, so can not comment on Anti-Ghosting or game related performance.",

Added a cheap pink-pudding keycap set and silver/white braided cable to create a customized look. Great value at all for under $100 CAD. Thought I might have to switch to heavier springs or switches, but the Outemu red switches are perfect for her. They offer slightly more resistance than the equivalent Gaterons in my board, and are pretty smooth from the factory. No quality control issues. The per-key RGB and effects are awesome on a board this cheap. No need to mess with cumbersome RGB software. The brushed silver frame is nice looking and very solid. Flip up legs put it at the perfect typing angle. I added some foam for sound deadening and now it sounds great relative to the price.",

There is no software or any way to fix this from what I can tell, which absolutely sucks.This kb is just so NICE especially for the price! There are lots of reviews and I'm no expert in keyboards but I'll throw in my two cents!Cons:- The font on the keys is slightly off putting and I'll probably replace the keycaps eventually- Speaking of key caps, turns out they are not double shot but they didn't claim to be and that's on me (^^)- The RGB is nice but there's no way to keep it at a single colour in the various colours it does have in the rainbow option which kind of sucks given it has that range! In general, limited lighting options.- It gets noticeably dusty fast so you gotta keep it clean!Pros:- To me, I like the loud blue switches but good luck playing or working at night without having your family hate you!- Finding a nice mechanical white keyboard in a budget is hard so its good value- No extra backplate added at the sides so takes up less space- Fairly sturdy",
