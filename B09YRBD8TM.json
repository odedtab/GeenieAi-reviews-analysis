    "Good value",
    "I was pleasantly surprised when I received this keyboard. It is better than I had expected. The keys feel good, quieter and softer than a mechanical, but with good bounce.  The rainbow backlighting has several options, and the  light comes up through the keys, lighting them up as well.  I have not yet tried all the color options, or brightness settings, but so far I am very happy with the lighting.  The keyboard itself is heavier than I was expecting (I recently switched from a gaming keyboard that was so light in weight that it felt flimsy). This one has a good weight to it, not heavy but not feather-light either. I use it mostly for working and web-browsing and so far I am very satisfied with it. It says the keys are \"laser etched\" which I hope means they will hold up and not be as susceptible to wear as my last keyboard, which showed extensive key-wear after only about 2 months!  Five stars to this one.",

    "Quiet But Clunky for smaller hands. Good for a cheap keyboard though.",
    "I needed a keyboard that was less noisy. The one I use is mechanical so it makes quite a bit of noise if I ever record something. It still makes noise but it isn't as bad and noise cancelling on your app or computer makes it hard to hear if you record anything. It's a bit clunky for my small hands. I don't care for the height and prefer more flat keyboards with retractable stands. Ironically because of the extra \"space\" for your palms at the bottom which I never liked I do have to use the stand to angle it a little to be comfortable despite that I don't care for the height. For a cheap keyboard it otherwise isn't too bad. Also the keys can pop off for easy cleaning which was a very nice option too. Edited: I did find the instructions and there is a way to turn off and adjust the lighting which I previously said there was no option. I stand corrected and have increased my ratings.",

    "I appreciate that the silent keyboard is compact and lightweight",
    "The silent keyboard has been a game-changer for me in terms of productivity and comfort. This keyboard is designed to be quieter than traditional keyboards, making it an excellent option for people who work in shared spaces or who prefer a quieter typing experience.The keys are responsive and comfortable to type on, with a satisfying tactile feedback that helps me to type accurately and quickly. The keyboard is also designed to reduce the strain on my hands and wrists, which is important for anyone who spends a lot of time typing.I appreciate that the silent keyboard is compact and lightweight, making it easy to move around and take with me on the go. It's also easy to set up and use, with no complicated software or drivers required.The design of the silent keyboard is sleek and modern, with a slim profile that looks great on my desk. It's available in a variety of colors, so I was able to choose one that fits my style and personality.Overall, I highly recommend the silent keyboard to anyone who wants a quieter, more comfortable typing experience. It's a high-quality product that has improved my productivity and reduced my typing-related discomfort.",

It's not long or elevated enough to actually support your wrist, unless you have tiny hands or type with you fingers folded at a 90 degree angle. They shouldn't advertise it as such.

    "This keyboard is fairly well built and water resistant with water drains in the back. Works and responds well and have a nicely multi functional keyboard lighting . The drawback though is the keyboard lighting setting button placement shortens the space bar. For a right handed player this isn't a problem. But for a left handed player that plays with arrow keys and space bar taps with thumb , this is now very awkward with this keyboard. I have to reach over 3 function size buttons rather then normal two to thumb tap the space bar during gamming. It is the main reason for me that this keyboard doesn't get a full 5 stars. I've learned to stretch my right hand more , but this does delay my response time just a bit while gamming.",

This keyboard has a nice soft touch, so when you press the key, you get results, but more importantly, it's super quiet.  I LOVE this.  The back lighting is nice too.If the back edge of the keyboard (near the function keys) were elevated another 1/8\" to 1/4\", that would help.  I feel it's a bit low.  Also, the apron they put on the front of the keyboard isn't really useful.  It's too low to use as a wrist rest to avoid carpal tunnel syndrome.  I use a separate padded wrist rest for that, and this forces it to be an extra inch from the keyboard.  Fix those two issues, and this keyboard is perfect.I attached a picture showing my wrist rest pad and the keyboard.  That gap is not a game breaker, but the keyboard would be better without it.",

For example, if you hit CTRL CTRL CTRL, the 3rd CTRL keypress would be ignored.  I only notice this because I use CTRL often in some games for certain actions.  However, when I mentioned this defect to the manufacturer, they had a replacement at my door in just a couple of days.  Unfortunately, that one had the same defect.

On normal keyboards, your fingers might slide or be misplaced if you are gaming or typing quickly.3. It looks very cool!Cons:1. The keyboard is moderately quiet, not \"whisper silent\" as it says in the description.2. Not very ergonomic, the wrist rest is too low to provide any support for the wrists, so your hands are bent at an awkward angle during usage.Overall a decent, solid keyboard. 7.5/10 I think it'll last me for several years since it seems very durable.",

    "This is a nice keyboard, it's quiet and responsive and I prefer a wired keyboard over the wireless. Even if you want to keep a backup keyboard at hand, this is an inexpensive selection that would be a good fit. This is also and easy keyboard to adapt to, and coming out of a mechanical keyboard for a long time, this is nice and comfortable. The lights turn on or if you don't like them, they can turn off. I prefer backlit keys, and this is a decent choice.",

    "Quiet, useful keyboard",
    "I previously had a \"gaming keyboard\" with loud, clicky keys.  It felt and worked fine, but the noise was just too much.  This keyboard has good key feel and travel, but is very quiet.  It's illuminated, either solid or \"breathing\", and you can adjust the brightness, but that's about it.  The colors aren't changeable or programmable.  The lighting just gradually goes from green to red to blue left to right.  Which is fine if all you need is an illuminated keyboard for use in the dark.  My laptop recognized the keyboard immediately & with no problems upon plugging it in to a USB hub.  The keycap lettering is legible and the keys are laid out in a standard layout.The Win, FN, and \"light\" keys are near and as large as the Ctrl & Alt.  I'd prefer the Ctrl & Alt to be larger and the other 3 special keys to be smaller.  Other than that I have no complaints.",

    "Finally, a Decent Keyboard",
    "I date back to 7280 IBM keyboards that weight about 20 pounds but where sturdy and reliable.  Most of the keyboards today are junk, and it is hard to find a good one.  This keyboard was a pleasant surprise.  It is light weight, the keys are resistant in a good way, and the feel is right.  This isn't mechanical and the keys are silent, but the resistance is just right.  The lighting options are sparse but it does provide a good backlighting on the keys.  The \"wave\" lighting option is kind of annoying to me but the steady is good.  The only minor complaint is the bottom row of keys angle down which is a bit odd.  It didn't take long to get use to it, just a minor thing.Overall, this is a decent plug and play keyboard that provides the basics and is easy to use.",

    "I really like this keyboard. It is quiet, responsive, and comfortable to use. My only issue is the built-in wrist rest, which, being made of hard plastic, isn't much of a wrist rest, and which makes it slightly harder to keep my foam rest in place.",

    "This Gaming Keyboard, 7-Color Rainbow LED Backlit, 104 Keys Quiet Light Up Keyboard was the clutch hero that I needed to help me when every keyboard I owned had failed me.My awesome gaming rig that I built had crashed while I was testing overclock voltages and I needed to access the BIOS, but all the keyboards I currently have are wireless, but they should've also worked like a normal keyboard when plugged in, but they didn't.So, stuck without options and desperate for a solution, this keyboard came down from the heavens to rescue me from the depths of despair I had found myself in.As soon as I plugged in this keyboard it worked, I was able to access the BIOS and run Defaults to restore everything to normal.Overall, I'll always hold on to this keyboard just in case for the moments that the S hits the fan. 5/5 stars.",

    "Nice keyboard",
    "The keyboard is pretty nice. I like the rainbow background color and there is also a button to remove the light on the keyboard. The response of the keys/buttons are good - so far I did not find any key is not functioning. Be AWARE this is not wireless - meaning it has a cord and sometimes inconvenient for some uses. But I guess it will have better response with the cord. Alright, I'm using it for office/typing purpose so I do not personally use it for gaming. Another thing I don't like about this is the height of the keys. I used to type on laptop a lot and the keys are relatively low. For this one, the keys are very high and not as comfort as the ones I used before",

    "This wasn't my first pick, I actually wanted a Keyboard with a single color light like white but those either were too low in height or delivery was too long compared to Prime speed. I bought this for my work because I work at night and I like to work with the lights off while watching tv and sometimes I was having a hard time seeing the keys. I like that the lights have 3 different brightness modes, off mode and Breath mode(slow flashing). Key strokes feel great, and some reviews say it's noisy but to me they are quiet and smooth. Overall I am 100% satisfied.",
