    "For my cats I always have a feeder availalbe for the with aa mixture of 4 or 6 differnt brands and flavors for them. Or pets are wild animals, not that long ago their natural instinct is to eat when ever food it available. Their instinct is not to eat on a schedule like we do now.Up until the industrial revolution even we humans did not have an eating schedule that conformed to a factory time table.By having food always available and water available thee cats will eat many times a day but will never gorge, it will only eat a morsel at a tine and which ever flavor it feels like at that moment. \"Do you want to eat exactly the same thing everyday, day after day.\" , Most normal people want varity.  This way my cats are never anxious about food and they are health and well fed. Beside if i am late coming home at meal time they will not go hungry. That's takes  the stress and anxiety out of getting food.  Fyi. Don't keep the food and water at the same place Spread the water out, different places to make them hunt for it. In the wild food and water is never in the place unless they are an alligator or a shark. I.have three cat water fountains. One in the kitchen,  basement and utility room. No matter what door my be closed there will be water available.",

My kids told me that they new about this issue, but would just shake it or use their hands to bring the cat food down. I had not known it was an issue. Evidently our cat found food somewhere else and was still alive when we returned but he took several days to come home, probably because he thought we had gone forever. Poor cat.

The water bowl side is a different story. When filling the water side there is a small rubber gasket that the gravity feeder won\u2019t work without so you have to make sure it\u2019s in place each time you fill it. Several times it\u2019s fallen into the jig as we fill it and we\u2019ve had to empty the jug to remove it. Also the bowl part of the water feeder is extremely hard to keep clean. I also recommend keeping to two a good distance apart as most dog tend to carry food over and leave chunks of dry food in the water side which makes you have to clean the water bowl more often.",

The water rises about a 1/8\u201d of an inch from the top of the bowl, making my pugged face dog drop almost an ounce of water outside the dispenser every time she laps her water. The domed lip makes it challenging to clean without removing four screws.  2) Petmate Replendish Automatic Gravity Waterer. The sizeable domed lip holding the water bottle is impossible to clean. I didn\u2019t mind it until I had a caddisfly infestation. Some found the lip\u2019s underside the perfect hiding place to hatch its larvae. Swimming fly larvae in your dog\u2019s water bowl is gross, so I threw the entire unit into the trash. 3) Aspen Pet Lebistro Cat and Dog Water Dispenser looks even worse, giving even greater access to aquatic insects that could nest under its domed lip. 4) The Petmate Pet Cafe Waterer Cat and Dog Water Dispensers are the easiest to clean and assemble without spilling more than a few drops of water during the refilling process \u2013 simply the best of the bunch.",

The top pops off so it's super easy to fill.2.  It will hold a 3lb bag of cat food easily.3. The top locks in place so kitty can't headbutt it and knock it over as he'd learned to do with the other gravity feeder.4.  It's plastic.  It's easy to clean.5.  The bowl is big enough for both our fur babies to eat at the same time.Cons:1. I don't dislike this feeder enough to send it back or continuously search for another.  But I'm not super crazy over how it dispenses or doesn't dispense the food.  Once kitty has eaten from the bowl, the food doesn't refill and he has to use his paw to rake it down.It might work well for a small dog and rounded pellets of kibble.In other words, when I travel I don't have to worry, the cats will have plenty of food and again, they can rake it out.

These are a great solve for that, but they\u2019re a little flimsy, and the food can get hung up in the feeder. When that happens, your dog might attack it because he is of the mind that he will never eat again. And when that (italics) happens, he might pop the top off (it\u2019s very easy to do) and stick his entire head in it to get the last little bit. I would have given it five stars if he could have gotten his own head out. I\u2019m kidding. I would have given it five stars if it had been a little thicker plastic and if the food flowed better into the dish. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019ll last in my backyard, even out of the sun, and especially with a jumpy boy like this one.

Ain't no big thing.Size:The large size seems quite big but not ridiculously big.Fine for my mid-size lab.Probably fine for a great dane.probably unnecessarily large for a small or teacup dog.The small size is perfect for my cats.I'm sure would be good for small or teacup dogs.Those complaining about water leaks - if your LARGE water dispenser didn't come with a spring-loaded stopper, you'll have problems.  Contact the seller and get a replacement.People complaining about the food dispenser getting knocked over and the top coming off:I've never had that problem w/ my calm dog.  I think this is a RARE issue.But, agreed - the top is NOT screwed on, it's a pressure lit kind of like tupperware but a smaller lip so it's not a struggle to remove when adding more food.That said..I guess the option is to buy and try, and then return or add somen (admittedly) ugly packing tape to hold the top on from your rambunctious pets.I think this has been a problem for the small dispenser with some dogs.The large dispenser's top is fine, As i said, hasn't been a problem at all for me.People complaining about large water bottle collapsing from water pressure -- hasn't been a problem for me.That said -- DO twist the water bottle after putting it on the base so it's held in place.And when transferring from counter to floor, take care to NOT undo the twist.Some videos for this product neglect to do the twist...that's a mistake. !As for the items -- they work well, the price is good, I'm pleased.-- PTPGR",

    "This review is for the Amazon Basics Pet Water Dispenser. I say this because Amazon likes to combine the reviews for the food dispenser with those for the water dispenser. I've owned several water dispensers in the past and none was as good as this one. With all of the others, as soon as you invert the bottle, the water starts coming out. This one has a spring-actuated valve that keeps the water from coming out until you place the bottle in the bowl and push down. You then rotate the bottle slightly counterclockwise in order to secure it to the bowl. The bowl has a large opening for the water to come out. My previous units had a tiny hole that could easily get clogged. I like this unit so much that after using it for several months, I decided to buy a second one. If you live alone, you need to have at least one gravity-fed food dispenser and one water dispenser. This way, if you have a medical emergency at home, or worse, outside the home, your pet will have food and water until you are able to return. Avoid the battery operated ones. The electronics could fail or, more likely, the batteries could leak and keep the unit from working.",

This tilts the bowl slightly towards the container and now water sits below the lip of the bowl. Still wise to keep it on a tray.My dog used to hoard water. If there was a quart of water in his stainless steel bowl, he'd drink it and bring me the empty bowl. With this set up, he no longer hoards water.

    "I purchased this feeder when my automatic dispensing cat food feeder quit working. That one lasted for years and years through many vacations... but I was always concerned since it needed electricity to run and we are prone to thunderstorms and power outages where we live. So I decided to replace it with a simpler one that was not dependent on electricity to dispense the food. This feeder arrived just a week before we were leaving on a 2 week vacation. I read all the other reviews and knew that the food container was not secured to the base and could be easily knocked over, spilling the food all over the place. To make sure this didn't happen, my husband placed bricks on 3 sides of the feeder (right side, left side and back side) and stacked them up so they were as tall as the feeder. As I have 2 young, playful cats - I knew they would eventually knock the feeder over and these bricks would hopefully prevent that from occurring.  I am happy to say that in the month this feeder has been in use, the bricks have prevented the feeder from being knocked over!  When the feeder arrived ( I bought the small size) it was actually smaller than I expected and much smaller than the old automatic one we were accustomed to. But if the feeder is filled, it seems to last my 2 cats almost 2 weeks. It is easy to refill, as the lid lifts right off and new food can be poured into the canister from the top without even moving the feeder. The area where the dry food flows out of the container into the base dish doesn't appear to get jammed and I have already seen one of my cats paw at this opening to release more food into the dish. In conclusion, with the brick enclosure in place...this feeder works well and is a great value for the money!",

    "My bunny drinks LOTS of water and this is perfect for him. I had dogs in the past and water bottle and bowl were a lot bigger but it was just too much for my bun. He's a Holland Lop and his ears reach the floor so a bigger bowl meant they'd be soaked. I can't for the life of me remember how many days it lasts me but I think it's just a few days short of a week. It's super easy to take apart and put back together. The only think I don't love, is that there are some areas that are a bit difficult to get to, but I understand the reason it's so perfect is because of those things, so changing them would completely change the product and make it less great. TIP: I learned that 1 Q-tip or 2 solves that issue real quick. Those areas are the small crack in the bowl and inside the small water dispenser's lid. The crack has to be that small to properly control the dispersed water but squeeze a Q-tip in there a few times and you're good to go. The lid/dispenser feels a bit fragile at times but be gentle and you should be good cause I've had it for at least 7 months with not a single issue. On both sides there were tiny areas that sometimes get a little slimy but I found that the best and easiest way to clean it properly was to use a Q-tip there too. I don't think it would be that great for big animals, but for small or medium this will definitely do the trick.",

    "I have been using the first one of these for about two years now.  I ordered a second for a separate room in the house about a year later.  They function as advertised and have held up well over time with one caveat: THEY ARE NOT DISHWASHER SAFE!!I left for a funeral 5 days ago and tossed all of the dog bowls etc. in the dishwasher before I went, because I didn't have time to hand wash like I usually do.  Big mistake.  The base of the bowl held up great, but the bottles came out all warped and busted so they're unusable now.  I am ordering two more of the same unit to replace them, which I think is evidence enough that I have been thoroughly satisfied with it overall.  Just don't make my mistake.  Handwash only.  The item may have come with a note saying it wasn't safe for the diswasher... if it did, I probably forgot over the last two years of owning and using them.  I'm going to chalk up this experience as user error, not necessarily any fault of the product itself.Would I suggest this product to others?  Absolutely if you are ok hand washing them.Would I order it again?  Yes, and I have multiple times now.  I am ordering two more of the same ones to replace the two I destroyed in the dishwasher.",

    "It works fine. I got it for my cat that doesn't have any interest in drinking water. I thought the fact that it wouldn't be completely stagnant would draw him in, but he couldn't care less.The bowl refills slowly which is fine. My issue is how quickly a film forms on the plastic of the bowl. It happens about two days of use which would be fine if you have a dog. They drink more and more often so I imagine you would be handling this more regularly. But if you have a cat, there's no way they can empty this bowl before it needs to be cleaned.You have to either tap the bottle off (still filled with water) and carry both that and the filled bowl to the sink without spilling, or you have to carry the whole damn thing to the sink. Either way, water will be spilled.",

    "Why did they change the design?",
    "This is my second Amazon Basics Gravity Pet Waterer. The first one (purchased in 2020) was wonderful, the dish and bottle connector were molded from a single piece of plastic (which matches the photos shown for this item). The bottle snapped on snugly and was easy to get off when empty, and you didn\u2019t have to rotate it a certain direction to align it with the base. It worked perfectly and did not leak. The only reason I replaced it is because in taking it to my son\u2019s house so he could dog sit for us, someone tripped and fell on top of it, cracking the base of the water dish.I am VERY unhappy with this one. It DOES NOT match the photos shown for the item. (See my photos attached to this review.) Even though it has the same Item number and ASIN, it is NOT the same. They changed the design of the dish such that the bottle connector is a separate piece attached to the dish via four screws. There doesn\u2019t appear to be any extra seal between the dish and connector, so if you happen to tilt the dish back a little \u2013 as often happens when moving it \u2013 water pours out the back! It also traps water between the top of the dish and the bottom of the connector where mildew can grow, and it is very difficult to clean.Next, instead of an easy snap-on design, the bottle now has nubs on it that you have to align with notches in the top of the bottle connector and then twist COUNTER-clockwise to \u201csecure\u201d it. I put that in quotes because it is not nearly as secure as the old model that snapped on. If you think you have it aligned and you don\u2019t (because of course you can\u2019t SEE the stupid nubs when you\u2019re holding the bottle upside down over the dish!), it\u2019s possible to have the bottle fall off the stand. And whoever designed this never heard of \u201clefty loosy/righty tighty.\u201d Who doesn\u2019t know this? What other connector do you twist LEFT to secure it?Finally, the old bottle cap screwed onto the bottle and fit snugly without having to be too tight. This bottle cap has a silicone o-ring that is so loose it falls out every time you unscrew the cap (sometimes ending up INSIDE the bottle), and often gets misaligned when you screw the cap on, which causes the bottle to leak when you turn it upside down to set on the base.We have also had to put the whole waterer in a shoe tray because it just leaks. I suspect this is because the top of the bottle cap is above the level where the base meets the dish, so if the seal isn\u2019t good the water level is too high, and again, water leaks over the side.The whole thing is such a poor design I\u2019m just going to return it. If there is ANY way to get another of the original design, I want to do that. This one is horrible! The manual seems to indicate this is a recent redesign (V3-8/21). AMAZON, are you listening? Please give us the old design back!Update: edited to fix spelling errors.",

It fits almost an entire bag of cat food and the water dish keeps them from moving the dish around and making a puddle which they use to do with their old one. I only have to refill the water once a week but I do have the clean out and freshen the drinking area daily because they are always dropping fuzzies in it lol but it doesn't backwash so no contamination and it always releases just the right amount of water. But careful it is pretty heavy.

    "We got a puppy a few weeks ago to join our older dog and crabby senior cat.

This is a nice solution! He sometimes puts his paws in but he doesn\u2019t perceive it as a potential toy.It\u2019s working as intended, but we had a hard time getting it to work at first. Filled it up, screwed on cap, added to base but nothing would happen. After a combination of twisting it and a few hard bops on the top of the tank when it was connected, it started flowing fine and we haven\u2019t had a problem since upon refilling. It might just have been stiff or not quite sized right between the cap and the seat it sits on.

Then, when the reservoir had less water in it and was therefore lighter, she knocked it over and made more of a mess. We had a similar waterer before, except the old one was much larger, and never had any problems, so I am thinking it could be because this has such a clear reservoir that she can see the bubbles?

    "Excellent for house rabbits!",
    "I love this water bowl. My partner and I have house rabbits, and have always used a regular spill-proof bowl for their water and food. Since fresh water is critical for rabbits to have at all times, we would wash and fill the bowl every night and most mornings as well, which was never a problem. But then we adopted a third bunny, and suddenly the volume of water being consumed overnight or during the day was more than the volume of the large bowl, and we needed something compact that could ensure access to clean water for longer. This gravity-fed water bowl is excellent at doing exactly this. I was worried that it might be top-heavy and therefore easy for them to knock over, but after a few weeks, there have been no issues, and it seems secure and stable. I was also worried about leaking, as this seems a common issue for these styles of watering dishes, but again, I have noticed no issues with this so far. I was really pleased with how the gallon jug snaps firmly in place, and do not find it hard to remove, though find it best to do this in the sink to avid making a minor mess. I now monitor the water dish for fur and food contamination, and enjoy how I can take the whole thing to the sink, scrub out the bowl, and then tip it forward enough that the bowl empties of the soiled water and rinses itself, and then refills with the fresh water. It's very convenient, and my rabbits seem to enjoy it. If I could offer any improvements, I would really prefer the base to be high-quality stainless steel, and the reservoir to be made of glass, but models like that are not as well rated as this one, and I feel like this is an excellent product, despite being made of plastic.",

    "I have a German Shepherd, but wow, the \"Large\" size is really large. What is that puppy they have in the picture, a Great Dane?The bottles are too thin and flimsy. I can see the water bottle flexing under it's own weight in the dispenser when it's full, and this could definitely cause the leak proof cap to cut off the water supply as some others have mentioned. Especially if it is bumped, or a cat jumps on top of the bottle. I hope the manufacturer takes this issue seriously, and ups the bottle quality just a bit. I imagine this is less of an issue in the \"Small\" size, but for now I'm only filling the bottles about half way. This let's me clean them more often, and keep the food and water fresher anyways.Edit: 06/30/2019. I have two dogs now, and I've been sticking with the filling 1/2 full, and these have been working fine. I would still recommend going with the smaller size. I feed my dogs a mix of wet & dry in the morning in their regular bowls to keep them excited to eat and maintain routine, then let them free feed dry food and water from these during the day, and that seems to keep them at a perfect lean weight. Ultimately, for my dogs I want to put as much food/water as my dogs eat/drink in 3-5 days. After that, I need to clean them because the water starts to get cloudy, and the food may start clumping if they drink then eat. All in all, this has been a pretty good purchase.",

    "I ordered two of these waterers and I must say they are good quality. However, I have only had them for close to 2 years. One of them just cracked yesterday and the mess was annoying to deal with. The other seems to be working fine. I definitely do not think it should be almost $16 but it\u2019s the best one I\u2019ve found on Amazon. It is easy to clean and I clean it often. I don\u2019t know why people say it gets mold (that may be a personal problem). My main complaint is I wish the bowl had thicker plastic as the weight of having to flip it over (when the jug is full, there is a certain trick to it, unless I\u2019ve been doing it wrong, the other way would be to add the jug with the bowl already on the ground, but that would cause quite the mess) I think has caused it to crack. I did hope this would last me longer but oh well. Having to replace because I have tape under the crack in the meantime because I woke up to water spilled everywhere. I just wish it was cheaper. Definitely not worth the full 15 and change.",

You fill the bottle, screw on the cap then turn it any which way - totally upside down and set it onto the bowl - until you push it in, no water comes out.  If you pick it up and the bowl accidentally falls off - no big deal, only the little water in it spills - the bottle automatically won't leak once separated. Totally six stars worthy!2) The feeder bottle is almost as good but really fails tragically. It has two openings - very good.  One opening sort of clips onto the bowl and the other end has a rather loose fitting larger lid.  The trouble is they come apart easily and dry food goes everywhere if you're not really careful.  You have to put the bottle somewhere you can hold the lid onto it once it is full.  Then you set the bowl on and verwy, verwy carefulwwy turn the whole thing over, making sure all three separate pieces don't come apart while you're setting it down. It can be done - 3 out of five so far.  With just a simple threaded lid on the big end OR the bowl end would make this six star too- just something to keep it attached.

    "[TL;DR: spills if u pick it up wrong, but best dispensing action ever] first, i am very satisfied. this feeder is the absolute best out there when it comes to the flow of food, where many many others have failed in delivery. this is the feeder you want for that. however, like in many other reviews, the base and tank are barely attached when snapped in place... WARNING: if you load this on the counter, and then think you're gonna place it on the ground gently, enjoy picking up an entire bag's worth of food off the floor. it rests and lightly snaps, not screws into place. with a heavy tank it buckles with any significant  jarring, and dramatically falls out spilling everything fast. so don't carry it!... buuu-u-u-u-u-t, if you know this fact, and leave it on the ground when u fill it up, it still is by far the best, most consistent server. i've had several other feeders that were horrible dispensers. the basin is a big dish and it's rounded with no corners. so once your pet starts eating from it, gravity blocks the other food well, because it's not dropping in, it's conveying out on a slide. it leaves a short layer of food, and doesn't cascade over the old food stuck in the bottom or corners. there's not that much food exposed to the air at any given time either. it dispenses neatly, and is evenly accessible, so it doesn't go stale. i wouldn't recommend for medium sized dogs, or people with crazy sets of rambunctious kittens, because of the bump factor. otherwise highly recommended. tank looks almost 3/4 gallon, or 3 litres size. about the size of a large plastic instant coffee can. you could probably add a screw, or otherwise bond it with a health-safe adhesive too. but it's no big deal. top lid is easy to pop off. 5 stars + caveat.",

I use Pedigree food and this has been a problem with other feeders, but this one works perfectly. The waterer does not over fill and spill over so that too is nice. It holds a very large amount of food and water so filling them is not as frequently needed as my old ones, which is a good thing as this brings me to the cons..CONS: The water jug is NOT spill proof, not even remotely. It has a spring loaded check valve that is supposed to prevent this, but IT DOES NOT WORK at all. The ONLY thing I can do to limit the amount of water spillage and mess when refilling is to not turn it upside down until the very last second when installing the jug into the base. This is very difficult because it holds 2 1/2 gallons of water, so it\u2019s heavy, and you have to align the two lock tabs up with the slots in the base while installing. Also because of the difficulty in removing/installing the water jug it makes it a pain to clean the bowl. If your dog gets food etc. in there you have to go through this messy process to clean it, and then clean up the spilled water when you\u2019re done as well.Secondly, the lid to the food hopper does NOT secure at all, not even a little. It doesn\u2019t snap on or anything, it literally just sits on the top so the slightest bump knocks it off every time.If these two major design flaws were corrected, I would definitely give it 5 stars as it is great in all other aspects, but as it stands I can only give it 2 stars.",

Water soaked into the fabric pad I have underneath it. I bought a new one in Dec 2019 and have not had any problems. I still consider this a fantastic product, especially for the price. My only wish is to be able to buy the pieces separately in the case that something breaks. When the bottom plastic piece cracked, I asked Amazon if I could purchase just that piece, since the bottle was perfectly fine. They said no so I bought a whole new set. It wasn't about the money, but rather the plastic waste! I've been storing the old bottle in a closet since then.

    "Love it, easy fill, lasts a while",
    "Love this so far! I was so sick of filling a tiny water bowl for my big pup, especially in the summer. So I do a nice big fill occasionally and hes golden. This is the first 'auto-fill' / 'gravity' bowl I have bought so I wanted to say I remember hearing them make a loud 'glub, glub' noise when refilling that scared a number of family members' or friends' dogs. I was concerned about that at first because my dog is scared of most noises. He runs if you shake out a trash bag, break down cardboard, or pop bubble wrap, etc. but the price seemed good so I went with it and he has no issues. It does do a little glub, glub noise but he just ignores it and drinks away, yay! If i remember correctly the noise is much more subtle too than I remember on other brands, but it has been a while since I have seen one so not sure how reliable I am. My only minor complaint is it is messier (when he drinks) than his last bowl for some reason. I cant really figure out why though. It doesn't seem to over-fill I just don't know if the design makes him splash more with his tongue? Anyway it is worth noting, but I didn't knock a star off as its not that bad and his bowls are on an absorbent mat anyway. Overall I recommend it. Each to fill and place back on too!",

I now only use this dispenser for my three dogs instead of two smaller dispensers.  Only thing I wish it had was a deeper bowl area that prevented water from spilling when the dogs are drinking. I use a plastic tray underneath so all works out great.  Just make sure that the bottle is pushed all the way onto bowl portion so water flows easily.  I failed to ouch it all the way down until it clicked and the dogs ran out of water even though the bottle was still full! Oops! Only happened once! I learned after that one time.

    "I've always believed that these are the best dog bowls. You fill them up infrequently and they regularly dispense water and dog food for your puppy while taking out the extra legwork you'd have to put in if you were refilling them every single day. The water one is a bit new for me, as growing up I only had a food dispenser.I'm very happy with these dog bowls, even more so with the water bowl as it has allowed ease of including a breath freshener and tooth cleaner in Mickey's water that wasn't there with a regular water bowl. I don't have to fill it up on a constant basis, which is nice, and it has also eliminated the annoyance of Mickey digging at his water bowl when he wants to drink because there is always water available. One thing that's frustrating is that the water goes right up to the very edge of the bowl and does result in a lot of unwanted splashing, but it is ultimately manageable and not a problem in comparison to the help that these bowls are.They're compact and easy to move or carry if need be, for example, if you need to mop or vacuum the floor. These are definitely a useful perchase and while it took some time for them to arrive, I'm really glad I got them.",

My dogs tend to splash water out of the bowl onto the floor when they drink.  I don't think it would be a problem with a cat or small dog  You should put some sort of mat under the bowl to catch this water.  The one gallon bottle lasts about 24 hours and is enough for two 65 lb. dogs.  I don't think that I would like it to last any longer since I want to give them fresh water daily to keep it clean and prevent mold.  The only negative I have is that you can't put your hand/fingers inside the bottle to clean it.  The bottle comes with a cap that doesn't leak when you turn it upside down to place it on the base.",

If you are having issues with the water not coming out, either the bottle is not level on it, or you haven't pushed the spring-loaded cap all the way down, and then you give it a turn to get the water to start flowing. And the water definitely flows. There are pros and cons.Pros:The cats and dogs both love it.Even the small waterer holds a sufficient amount of water. I have three dogs and two cats. I bought two waterers and can go several days before having to fill either one.It seems sturdy and well made and does not seem like it will be an issue to clean.Cons:The actual bowl where the water flows into is angled, so the water fills all the way to the lip of the bowl. I believe this is a design flaw, as when my dogs use it, the water gets splashed everywhere because it is all the way to the edge. If the water would not fill so high, this would be perfect and I would recommend it to everyone. I guess it depends on how much water you want to be cleaning up all over your floor.

    "I don't care what vets and animal health professionals say about gravity feeders be problematic for encouraging obesity, when you have 4 cats this is far better than establishing feeding times on a daily basis. If you want something that is simple and easy to use then this is the best route to go, the hole in the top makes it easy to add more food without having to separate the unit. I give it four stars because the gravity feed itself isn't always on point, rather than having a slow continuous food flow there will be reduction of the level until a small \"avalanche\" drops into the bowl, but it has never caused a mess for me. To prevent that from happening just give the top container a few twists as the bowl level gets lower and this will help the food flow in slowly and evenly.",

My dog would eat and eat and eat until there\u2019s no more food left, and that\u2019s why this is definitely not good for a dog that\u2019s about to be overweight or already overweight.Week 2:  as shown in the pictures that\u2019s what\u2019s left at the end of the day on DAY1! My dog ate THAT much.  Well, that\u2019s not healthy! As you can also see the water spills everywhere.  I get that my dog can be a messy drinker, but what you see is a combination of water that overflows from the bowl.  What you see at the bottom of the bowl is crumbs of dog food after my dog had eaten her food and then drank the water out of that bowl.I thought this would solve the problem of my teenage kid forgetting to feed the dog, but I guess not.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.",

    "I bought this set a few days ago, since the one I had cracked.  I had that one for 8+ years.  I thought the previous one I had was great, but this one is MUCH better.  The water jug actually has a spout on it, to hold the water & the base that holds the water is much larger than my other one.  My previous one did not have a spout and the opening was smaller, so some days it was a challenge just to get the jug on the base.  I would pray that the water jug got on the base the first try, without any spillage.  I didn\u2019t really need the food dispenser, but since it was a set & pretty good deal, I replaced the food dispenser as well.  I highly recommend this pet feeder & waterer!  I recommend at least the waterer to pet owners.  My Boxers drink a lot of water, so this helps out quite a bit.  I clean mine out with soap & water twice a week, since I have droolers!  I also add ice to the jug.  When I first got it, I put ice in the base opening & my puppy was entertained for hours!  I don\u2019t recommend that unless, you like cleaning up pools of water!

    "Good size, this brand was the cheapest we could find at the time of purchase. The food gravity feeder works top notch and has no issues, the bowl is deep enough for a big dog and if left alone (by our kids) the food tends to stay inside the bowl. It doesn\u2019t over pour food into the dish so the dogs don\u2019t make huge messes with it as they eat. The water feeder is great because our dog drinks so much water we were filling a large bowl 5+ times a day and she would still stand up and turn on the water faucet due to having dry bowls. One \u2018issue\u2019 we\u2019ve noticed though is when you first fill the water jug and flip it, the jug doesn\u2019t drain right into the bowl. You have to tip it backwards after setting it on the bowl and let water gradually drain into the bowl, let a few air bubbles pass through and then it will drain regularly until needing filled again. It takes 10 extra seconds but still a tip for future buyers if theirs works like ours does.",

Other than that it's top full just buy a nice scoop to make it quick on filling and enjoy it's a good product.

The food dispenser has an opening on top with a lid for easy fill up, but the canister can pop off of the base if it is bumped too hard.  So if animals are playing and romping around it and land on it then it will come off.  Just an FYI.  The waterer is easy to fill and attach, it has a screw cap on the bottom that has a valve that releases water as the level goes down.  It is not too big although it is about 14 inches with both food and waterer side by side.  It should prove to be helpful if you need to be gone for a few days.

    "Another great value from Amazon.  Clearly designed by folks who own pets.  However, two design suggestions for the water :  1) modify the water container to allow a better grip when refilling.  When full, the container weighs around 20# and is slippery when wet.  We applied some rough duct tape around the container to make it less slippery.  2). The water fills the bowl to the brim.  Our cats are slobs and often leave food bits in the water.  Picking up the water dispenser to empty the food-bit contaminated nasty invariably leads to nasty on the floor.  A simple solution would be to lower the hole in the dispenser so that the water is 1/2\u201d or so below the rim.  A little chewing gum (non-flavored) as a plug does the same thing.",

I purchased the small size and the dry food container is out of proportion for the size of a cat, it holds an exuberant amount of dry cat food. Cat food kibble is tiny compared to dog kibble so the large container here is unnecessary. I know the picture shows a fairly large dog eating, but this product is marketed for \"small pets\" as well, when really it would be better marketed for small dogs. It takes over an entire 6lb bag of cat food to fill this container. Also the size of the food bowl is pretty huge for a cat. I feel like most cat food bowls are smaller, again this is more the size of a dog food bowl. It just dispenses a piggish amount for a cat.

When that happens, it gurgles and bubbles float up within the reservoir.  This is all perfectly normal.  I have 3 dogs.  1 Dog has no issue whatsoever.  The other two were initially petrified of the bubbles and gurgling.  Over the last month, they have acclimated to some extent.  They will drink if we are standing with them and holding them, but they still shy away from the bubbles.

I have had no issues with anything about it.  You simply fill the container, screw the cap back on, and set it on the base.  The water will flow into the bowl by gravity, and so long as there is water in the main container, it will keep the bowl filled with water.  I have a small puppy (about 4/5 lbs) and he has no problem drinking out if it.  He does seem confused when it makes a gurgling sound as more water enters the bowl, but he's not afraid or anything like that.  I'm glad I purchased this product.

It was hilarious watching him get startled when it started to refill the bowl, and bubbles were sent up through the reservoir.The feeder on the other hand we\u2019re not a fan of. We use it just to hold our dog food, and have separate bowls for the cats food. The reservoir on the feeder holds a large amount of food, and should keep it fairly fresh. It is easy to refill once set up due to the large cap on top. Unfortunately though, the reservoir for the food is not secured very well at all when attached to the bowl. Not sure if it was just a defect with the one I received, but the reservoir disconnected from the bowl THREE TIMES just while trying to set it up somewhere safe, which caused several pounds of food to be spilled all over the floor. It seems that even a fairly light bump will disconnect it from the bowl causing a huge mess. I have mine positioned against a small wall in between closet doors so that the reservoir is at least somewhat supported, and it\u2019s seemed to work without making a mess now.TL;DR:Waterer works great, holds a lot of water, and is good for multiple pets.Feeder will probably end up making a huge mess at least a couple times throughout its use",

I find myself having to shake the food down (standard Purina dog chow) to fill the bowl, it doesn\u2019t always flow out on its own - which essentially defeats the purpose of an automatic feeder. It does hold a lot of food, which is nice, so I don\u2019t find myself constantly refilling the container.",

The Food dispense on the other hand is a little bit flimsy. If you own a smart dog they could easily run at the container and knock the entire container over. A smarter solution would be for the food container to screw into the plastic portion that way only a human could untwist the container.",

We knew we wanted one with a large bottle for water so we would never accidentally have the puppy run out of water. This one took a little getting used to because of the valve that controls the water. Once we pushed it into place (took a little more pressure than our previous bottle) it worked very well. At least with the valve we have not spilled any water as we tip the bottle into position. Our previous bottle was controlled by gravity and would make a small mess as we turned the bottle upside-down to put into place. This one is very clean and easy to operate.

He doesn't tip it as easily, and if the drinking water gets too dirty, I'm only dumping out a little water, not an entire bowl.  Honestly, he can still throw this around like a toy and waste it all if he's bored, but it's better than a standard bowl until his permanent outdoor area is complete.We also have a large farm dog that digs in her water bowl for fun, so I can't see her using one of these - she'd learn how to separate it and would just chew it up.

Design with a thingy I have to unscrew is stupid. STUPID. Water seeks its own level, so a competent designer could have made it w/o the stupid piece I have to unscrew.  Amazon: FIX THIS or rename from basics to AmazonJunk<grin>.Update 2/2020Still junk but we lasted a while.

This caused a constant hazard on our hardwood floors by making them extremely slippery around the water bowl.It got so bad, that we had to replace it with a new water dish from another manufacturer. Also, since we replaced it within 1 week after purchase, we decided to donate it to an animal shelter.

Unless you got a huge breed that drinks tons of water everyday, you're going to end up with probably just replacing the water once a week. Not as clean and fresh as if you just pour fresh&clean water to a regular bowl.- Because it's \"self-dispensing\", the water is always going to fill up the entire bowl, which makes it hard to handle if you're trying to clean it, move it or even wiping surrounding areas when there's still water inside.- Also because the water is always full, large breeds will very easily make a mess when they drink from this bowl. We ended up having to buy a large mat to put under it AND wipe it every day; otherwise our hardwood floor will be ruined soon.Pro:It's self-dispensing.",

We had tried just using a bowl, but her clumsy feet meant she knocked everything over. I figured, top heavy, harder to dump, and I could put a puppy pad under it to catch splashes. Prior to putting it in the kennel, I had it near the cat food and had no spills, just kitten splashes that dirtied it more so.Fast forward to the first time we clean the kennel, set up the waterer, it's doing its *glug glug* thing while it fills, and puppy is fast asleep on the couch not paying attention to it. 10 minutes later, the freshly cleaned kennel was a tiny blanket swamp and still flowing. I removed it, soaked up the water, made sure the nozzle (is that the word for that special type of cap it has?) was aligned correctly, tried twisting it & gave it another ten minutes. Another flood.I would return it but it's honestly a lot of work, and I no longer have the box. I'm not sure what went wrong between using it with the cats, vs putting it in an empty kennel, but I'm fairly disappointed because it was a lot easier to clean and snap together than ones I've had in the past.

Ordered, opened it, and found a  water reservoir twice the size of our 1-lb dog. I mean, that's FINE, but this is for medium-sized dogs. Our dog would drink for a month with this thing. It also has a MASSIVE footprint so keep that in mind when ordering. It fills up way too high and was always on the verge of overflowing. The reservoir was also pretty tough to seat on the back. So, this is 3 out of 5 stars for me. It's sitting on the floor, waiting to be donated to a local pet shelter. We went back to the Replendish because while hydration for Small Dog is important, we can get by with a reasonably-sized reservoir versus an in-home water tower.",

I heard a pop and then no water came out. I looked at the cap and found that it was broken - it fell apart. There is a black stopper, a spring, and what looks like a small rod that is attached to the cap. When you turn the bottle upside down to connect it to the base, no water comes out. I thought this was neat and enjoyed that no water escaped. However, I found that due to the cap breaking and I am not sure how, the water got stuck and would not release into the waterbowl. I tried to fix it, but could not. I am quite disappointed and am surprised this could break after a couple months with minimal \"tear\" and such. I will be finding a new water bowl for my two doggos.

    "I was kicking it old school and refilling my pup's water pan daily, maybe twice a day. This came in pretty handy as a replacement. However, the only downside is that the water sitting in the bowl can easily become contaminated, with anything from dust to the dog's own fur. I'm a fussy mom who likes knowing my dog has water that's as fresh and pure as I would drink. But my laziness got the best of me and I've still kept this waterer. It gets the job done.",

The problem is that neither the lid connecting to the bottle nor the bottle connecting to the base is really connected.... they are more less just sitting on top of each other.  I had to move it a little after filling it, and while I carefully grasped from the bottom I held onto the body/jug for balance, and boom.... food everywhere, and while trying to fix that fantastic mess, the lid came off.

It just sucks that you have to modify a product because it doesn't work the way it should out of the box...Around the house I found an ODWALLA Juice top that both fit inside the cap snugly so I drilled it out and pressed it in. It stops the water at just over 1/2\" deep which to me is optimal for splash reduction while still deep enough to drink.My pet sitters tell me the water level looks low but I remind them that as long as there is water in the bottle it will continue to autofill to that level.",

My dog stopped drinking from it entirely unless we cleaned it thoroughly every single day. There are just too many crevices for bacteria to grow, it is far too large to clean completely, and takes about 15 minutes if you try.  That's too much work for an every-day thing. We gave up on it after a couple months and bought a regular stainless steel bowl. We have to change the water and re-fill a lot more often, but I feel that my dog is safer drinking from that than this bacteria ridden jug.

    "I really loved this waterer when it first came in the mail. The bottle is very nicely designed to not spill when you are reattaching it to the bowl. However, the first day I came home the bottle was empty and there was a huge puddle on the floor. I thought the bottle leaked! After refilling the bowl and watching the dogs drink from it I saw the puddle was from that. The bowl fills up too high and combined with the sloped edges it creates this wave pool that just splashes everywhere. My dogs do drink water for about 30 to 45 seconds, so maybe the extended period of time contributes to the wave pool affect. I'm just refilling this bottle more than I was refilling a regular bowl, which is disappointing. I would not suggest if your dogs are already kind of splashy in a regular bowl.",

    "It leaves the bowl to full of water making for a mess everywhere on the floor.  if the jug was lower then the water level wouldnt' be as high.  When I just poor a pint of water in the bowl the dogs don't send water everywhere.When you fill the jug completely full the valve does not open as the weight of the water bends the flapper down and makes a seal.  I can hold the jug upside down and push in the valve all the way with my finger and nothing comes out.  You can use it without the cap but this raises the water level in the bowl making even more splashes. This product is very close to being good but falls way short due to some simple design flaws.  A taller lid with a grommet stiffening the valve sea or a shallower bowl would make this five starts.  How do I return it?  I've suffered with it for 6 months.",

I ended up only using it when he was outdoors because I had multiple cases of the jug being barely tapped while he was drinking and then letting the water all over my floors.The food bowl is useless. We use small kibble bits but it clogged constantly and did not refill the bowl. He ended up tipping it trying to get more food when we were out. I started using it for my cat food, which worked slightly better but not much.  A few times a day I still had to shake the top so it would refill the bowl.We had an issue with mold in the watering bowl.

The problem with this water dispenser is that you have to snap the bottle it in place to get the water to flow, and it takes quite a bit of effort to do so.  This is a problem when the water bowl is full and you need to empty it.  Since unsnapping the water bottle takes so much effort, it's nearly impossible to do it without spilling the water in the bowl all over.  The water bottle for every other pet water dispenser I've owned just sits on the bowl, so you just remove it and you can then pick up the bowl and dump it out.  I've never had an issue with the water bottle coming off so I'm not sure why this one snaps in place.  I'm returning this.",

It has a stop valve so you can lift it up, which is handy when your pet thinks it is funny to drop toys or food into the base and you want to clean it without draining the whole thing. It also securely latches down.I'd recommend getting the water one and buy the feeder elsewhere.Edit 4/15/2022: okay they're both terrible.

The water dispenser and feeder are both easy to fill, and they hold a decent amount of food and water, so I don't have to refill them as frequently.The only issue I have noticed is that if you have an aggressive or energetic pet, they may be able to tip over the feeder and water dispenser. Fortunately, I don't have that issue with my pet, but it is something to keep in mind if you have a particularly active or strong pet.Overall, I would recommend the Amazon Basics Automatic Dog Cat Feeder and Water Dispenser Gravity Feeder and Waterer Set. It works well, is easy to use, and is priced affordably. I give it 4 out of 5 stars.",

The fill level is almost all the way to the top - so a sloppy drinker, a slight bump by your foot, or even looking at this thing the wrong way will cause spillage - wish you could adjust so the bowl wasn't so full.",

    "AmazonBasics Gravity Pet Feeder. Small",
    "This feeder holds a lot of dry kibble which is good because I don't have to keep pulling out the dog food bag to pour into a dish.  And my dogs can easily eat out of the attached bottom dish.  I've tried two different sized kibbles - one small and the other larger and both tend to somewhat block up at the point where it is supposed to drop down into the dish but so far I haven't seen the dish empty while the kibble container is still holding kibble. So at this point I don't think it will completely clog shut like some feeders do.  I will keep an eye on that and update this review if I see the kibble is not dropping down into the dish.  I really worry about stuff like that happening since I don't want my dogs going hungry due to a malfunctioning feeder.You aren't supposed to put this feeder into the dishwasher, especially the clear kibble holding part.  I knew when I pulled it out of the box that it would melt and shrink up if I put it into the dishwasher since it's thin plastic.  I washed all three parts (dish, holder and lid) in warm, soapy water to clean them before using.  Overall, it seems to work o.k. but again, I will keep watching it to see if it clogs or not.UPDATE 10.25.17 - This feeder will clog up at the point where the dry kibble is supposed to drop into the feeding dish.  But all it takes is a light poke with the hand to get the kibble to fall down into the feeding dish.",

    "This is a nice set. I think the water dispenser is better designed than the food container. Everything is kind of thin and lightweight, but even without water the water dispenser stays together and upright. The food dish is good, too, but the top separates from the bottom pretty easily if there isn't food in it to weigh it down. There are little ledges on one side and a lip on the other, so the pieces will snap together, but they're pretty low-profile, so it's easy to pop the top on ... and right back off again. There's nothing else holding the top on the bottom except the weight of the food. I wish it snapped in more firmly. Altogether, good dish, especially if you're free-feeding or only giving food access for a certain amount of time each day (then taking it away). It holds more than you'd usually need for one dog in a day. We give our dog four cups of food each day so I can just dump it in the top and put the lid on, instead of dropping it into a bowl. It may or may not be any fresher this way but it is at least better protected from splashes and hair and things like that, and it's harder for our dog and us to kick this dish under our dog's bed. Plus this seems more pleasant for her to eat out of.I haven't had to scrub the water jug yet, so I'll let you know how that goes later!",

    "Even though it shows a dog in the image, I dont have a dog, but two cats. And I thought, maybe it can work for them. They dont usually eat the dry food at the same time, and they usually graze on it rather than making a meal of it like they do wet food, so may it would work better instead of always refilling their bowl. Well, let me say, this works great! Whats better is there is less mess with kibble lying all around their bowl for me to sweep up.What surprised me more was that this actually came with 2 feeders - one for food and one for water! They are different, so one is specifically for water, which only fills the bowl up to a certain level. While the food has an open top for you to pour the food into. The water you will need to remove the plastic from the base to fill up. I have a running water fountain for the cats as they seem to like the moving water more than still water, so I am still monitoring whether they are taking to it. But overall, I am pleasantly pleased by this new set up and the cats seem to take to it as well.",

In a nutshell the plastic doesn't look to be BPA free .AND. more importantly, when it arrived I had to clean the water valve.  Mine package is probably a fluke but I can only review it using my personal experience, and when I pulled out the valve it had a flake or two of something inside it.  Not know what it was I went into full Mom-Mode.  Hot water, soap and a mild bleach solution followed.After that initial stumble I have to say that I've been happy with these.  The dogs are using them, the dog food container is easy to fill, and the water dish is working perfectly.",

    "I love this, because it means I can go away for 48 hours without worrying about leaving water in dishes and stuff -- bits of stray food, dust, who knows what -- ending up in a water bowl, or my three cats ending up depleting the supply of dry food. They can't eat their way through this much dry food in 48 hours! (And because of one cat's health woes, I've had to scale back on the wet food supplies, so...)I'm not sure that Sir Fergus the Fat is as enamored of the dry food container as I am, however. He finds the clear plastic -- which I love, because it shows me how much is left, and tells me when I need to refill it through the convenient hatch at the top -- very frustrating. He can SEE all that food, but he can't get to it. He walks around the container, tapping it with a front paw. and meowing intensely. Maybe AmazonBasics should get an extra star for having created an entertainment device for a cat as well? He also fishes out each piece of food one by one, using a paw to extract it carefully from the tiny dish, instead of sticking his nose in and eating from a big bowl as before, so this may even have come up with a long-term solution to the Fergus the FAT moniker? Molly, meanwhile, just loves that she has an endless supply of fresh water and doesn't have to wake me up in the morning, yowling, to tell me to refill her bowl. Which makes me happy, too. Another thing that makes me happy is that the design of the water bowl doesn't require me to try and tip it upside down very rapidly in case I splash it all over the floor. Nope, there's a protective nozzle that seals it, and only releases the water once you have turned it upside down and inserted it into the bowl and fixed it in place. Win!Cats happy; their human is happy. Purrs are heard throughout the household.",

We already have issues trying to manage her weight so this does more harm than good to her.  LOL.For the rating itself, I give it a 4 star because it does come in handy for pets who knows their limits but I would definitely give it a 5 star if there is a way they can come up with a portion control dispenser.

    "I have wondered about these fill and forget for a few days feeders I must say and Amazon has offered me the chance to try one.  I can not judge it by others yet it looks like most I've seen and the quality seems good.  I especially like the water bowl as I can go two to three days without having to refill it for our rescue beagle.  The food, as expected, seems to encourage more intake and I had to ring it with salt between fill-ups to be sure no slugs decide it's also their food.  Within the limits of such a system this is definitely workable.  I especially like it when I'm leaving to go to the lake for a long weekend.",

    "I had a minor problem with water valve. The protrusion in the base that is supposed to press and oven the valve wasn\u2019t pushing the valve in far enough, so the water would only flow sporadically. I trimmed and attached a small piece of an adhesive felt floor protector (the kind you use on chair legs) to the valve, and that did the trick.  The water now flows.I could have used something else, but I already had the felt pads. I probably could have attached it to the protrusion on the base, but I opted to attach it to the valve side.I\u2019d consider giving it five stars if not for this minor design issue.

The bottom accepts the open part of the barrel and turns into a bowl. When the food runs low, pop the lid off of the top and pour in more.The plastic is thick and heavy and this is a fairly sturdy unit. As a gravity based feeder, it's worked great so far. The top and bottom are easy to sperate for cleaning and the openings are larger enough to get your hand and arm in the barrel. This makes washing and drying a snap.

    "Sometimes I am gone all day and my dog likes to eat when he wants and not just in the morning or evening.  I don't like leaving food out all day in a bowl because it does get stale and then the dry food is wasted.  So the gravity pet feeder and waterer is perfect.  It keeps food nice and fresh and you can refill from the top of the container and holds about 5 pounds of dry food or so.  He can go a few days without filling the canister with more food.  The water canister is very nice too and only lets enough water out to keep the vessel full but not too full to avoid spilling. For the water canister it has to be taken out for refilling but that is okay because it should be rinsed out and washed every few days to avoid algae or stale water.  My dog loves his new food and water canisters and the cats love the water canister too!The canisters are of medium weight and are made sturdy.  They do not tip over easily and they are very attractive looking too.  Very easy to use and best of all my dog loves his new canisters.",

    "Okay Dispensers with some Drawbacks",
    "This is a set of water and food dispensers for pets.  We have two cats and have been using these dispensers for a couple of weeks.  The food dispenser works well and one of our cats really enjoys it.  The other, older cat prefers the standard bowl of food.  Neither of them seems to care very much for the water dispenser, probably because the younger cat prefers a water bowl that moves the water around.  I also found that changing the water is a little of a challenge since you have to lift the water container up and that can be a little difficult (the container shuts the valve so the water doesn't spill out). The stand with the water bowl has to be held down when you lift or you risk spilling the water in the bowl area.  I think the addition of a handle to lift the container would help.  Otherwise, you have to pick the whole dispenser up, pour the water out of the bowl and then remove the container.  The food in the food dispenser seems to stay fresh if you fill it completely, though I usually do not do that.  I think these will be especially useful for when we are away for a few days.  I'd rate this item higher if the water dispenser was easier to change out.  Much of it depends on what your animal's needs are and how they react to the dispensers.",

    "Broke Before We Could Ever Use It",
    "We've got two large dogs and while these are definitely sized for big dogs -- though I will note that if you have a large dog, it's better to elevate their food and water because leaning too far forward to eat can contribute to bloat, which can be deadly -- they are also super cheaply constructed.For us, the food portion isn't terribly useful because I've never had a dog that would, on its own, eat a reasonable portion without supervision. If I were to put this in front of either of my dogs -- the 100 lb or 50 lb -- they would continue to eat until it was gone, and they were very ill. (Also, again, bloat, letting to a twisted stomach, is a real danger to fast overeating for big dogs.)The water portion is what I actually thought would be quite useful as our big mutts can go through a bowl of a water in a few minutes after they've been running around. But the reality is this set-up isn't very good. The plastic of the resevoir is very thin; so thin that once full of water and trying to put on the base -- where it latches in -- it collapsed under its under weight, bending in, cracking and ruining the water barrel on its very first use. Heck, I didn't even fill it completely (only about 2/3) with water and had this result.",

    "Update #2. Perhaps this bottle just needed a break As I have not been having any problem with the water not dispensing as it should into the bowl. The only thing that I\u2019ve noticed recently that I didn\u2019t notice before is that there\u2019s now a strong smell to the plastic bottle. Perhaps it\u2019s user error and some thing a little bleach rinse might help.Update: after watching this battle for several days now it does appear to be filling up the bowl it\u2019s just much more subtle than the first one I had. The first one would make big bubbles and I could hear it when the water was flowing as the kitties drank this one\u2019s just quiet. It\u2019s the new sleuth model :-) I would recommend us it\u2019s an easy to clean easy for the kitties to drink out of it is very good priceI bought this to replace one just like it that I\u2019ve had for a year and a half to two years before it stopped dispensing the water even though the little spring piece appeared to be fine. I filled up the new one and had a hard time getting the bottle down into the holder as it seemed too big. When I finally did get it to sit in it does not dispense water either. It\u2019s a bummer because it makes it useless as you have to make sure the bowl is filled manually as often as you would fill and change any other water bowl. Seems the quality of this product has declined. I gave it a one star because it doesn\u2019t work. And since I do have experience with this item from the past I can tell you it\u2019s easy to clean, and easy to use. I usually only fill with about half a bottle of water for the two cats and then wash the bottle in the bowl out about once every five days or so. It is important to pay attention to the spring area when you clean it as it can develop mold  in that mechanism. It\u2019s a great product when it works As reviews show, and as I said this one did not work at all from the start",

    "What this water dish does well, it does VERY well. It's easy to fill, with the bottle being large enough to hold several days' of water, but not so large that it doesn't fit under the spout of my kitchen sink. As long as you use a gentle hand to tighten it, it's easy to remove the cap and it still doesn't leak. In fact, it doesn't spill a drop when you're putting the bottle onto the dish. It also feeds water somewhat slowly into the bowl due to the narrow spillway, keeping it from splashing onto the floor. Good stuff!What it doesn't do particularly well: Stay clean when used outdoors. You're going to have to wash it with every refill or it'll turn green. It's a pain to wash inside the bottle, even with a bottle brush. A wider lid with the same narrow outlet would probably help. The rubber feet fall off easily when you're washing the bowl, and as my third purchase, I ended up removing and re-glueing them with krazy glue before I even put the dish out for the dogs.The dogs love this dish though, and the price is great, so I ended up buying the third one after I warped the second bottle in the dishwasher. The first one's still going strong indoors after years of use and light cleaning.",

    "I got this as I used to have the pet mate and the lip of the bowl used to get gross underneath/ hard to clean. This is way easier to clean however my dogs are WAYY messier with their water because the lip of the bowl is rounded and won\u2019t catch water. I do love that the water container doesn\u2019t release until it is pushed into the slots which makes it easier to change out the water without spilling.So if you\u2019re in between this and the petmate:Amazon: easy to clean and the water won\u2019t spill out when you\u2019re changing the reservoir. When the dogs are drinking water, it will get everywhere due to rounded bowl.Petmate: harder to clean because under the bowl lip is open. The reservoir will spill out, it needs to be assembled upside down. Water is contained better within the bowl when dogs are drinking.",

After arrival and set up the cats seemed to really like the station. Ice in the water provided cooling for the cats. We then added the matching feeder. Now the cats get the bulk of their food and water from the stations. The units are easy to clean and maintain. The units are basic no nonsense but work just as advertised . Certainly, they could be more rugged, but the price is great. I would recommend both the feeder and water dispenser to cat owners who want to safe time, and provide food and water to their cats.",

I found after filling and putting the cap on, depressing it a few times helps in it activating and filling the bowl as soon as you place it in. Cleaning the bowl is easy for me even with big hands, though I do use a large pipe cleaner to clean it while the canister fills.

It's big enough I can leave it for a few days without worrying. It's easy to fill up. I love that I can flip the bottle upside down and nothing will come out until I press it into the base. It's so much easier than the dance of trying to put the bottle on upside down then flip quickly without spilling anything. You need to clean the bowl out each time you refill the bottle, but the shape makes that fairly easy to do. You also need to clean out the part of the base the bottle connects to. That's a little harder to navigate cleaning, but not ridiculous. Highly recommend!",

Since we got this waterer, she can\u2019t knock that over, and they always have enough water so we don\u2019t have to worry about them. It\u2019s a little bit harder to wash compared to a glass, but it takes 2 minutes to clean it. As long as you keep the water fresh and clean, you\u2019ll enjoy this waterer.
